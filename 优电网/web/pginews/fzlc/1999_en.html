								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　Beijing Broadcasting Network, Beijing, August 7 (Reporter Tan Wei Zhou Yu) According to the China Radio and Television News, China Voice "News", in July, Guangzhou continued to experience high temperatures, and the electricity load repeatedly hit a record high. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More than 20 years ago, stable electricity use was difficult. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ye Lie-Ao is a native of Guangzhou, and his family also treasures old things like voltage regulators. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He said: "This used to be the standard for every household in the village. At the beginning, our booster was 1000 watts, and later it was 1500 watts, and then it was 3,000 watts. After 3000 watts were not working, it would trip. It can't be upgraded with the booster. If you can't finish your homework before six o'clock, it's over."
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　In the early days of reform and opening up, Guangdong's economic and social development was rapid, and electricity consumption was frequently rushed. Only urban and rural shards could take turns to limit electricity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Li Lizhen, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and chairman of the China National Grid Corporation Expert Committee, recalled that in the 1980s and 1990s, the factory often opened three stops and four stops. The blackout was a common occurrence in Guangdong.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi are rich in water resources. How to convert them into green hydropower “Express” to Guangdong? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1979, the development of Hongshui River began to brew. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1993, the first electricity in the west was “landed” in Guangdong, and the southern province (region) power grid was initially formed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1999, the state proposed the strategy of developing the western region. As a landmark project for the development of the western region, the West-East Power Transmission Project began to be built on a large scale. This is the largest energy transfer project in human history. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is not only hydropower that is sent to the east, but also coal power in the northern region, which has formed a transmission pattern for the north, middle and south. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Li Lizhen explained that the supply and demand sides of each road are separated by nearly two thousand kilometers, and the transmission is most suitable.　
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　Li Lizhen said: "The South Passage sends electricity from Yunnan and Guizhou to Guangdong. The middle channel is the Three Gorges to send to China and to East China. There are also the North Passage, which is Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, sent to North China, and sent to Beijing. Hydropower is to use transmission lines. The two projects that coal was sent out, one is to transport coal, and the other is to transmit electricity. Below 1800 km, transmission is more suitable."
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　The south line channel is the largest in the three lines. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the 18th National Congress, the main grid of the “West-to-East Power Transmission” south line has expanded significantly. Through 18 transmission aorta, the abundant hydropower resources in the southwest have passed through the mountains and rivers and rivers and rivers, and are continuously sent to the eastern region. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nowadays, in Guangdong, every three degrees of electricity is once a clean water and electricity from the west.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　This super project of West Power East is referred to as “Kunliulong DC Project”, which started in May 2018, and the project starts from Kunming, Yunnan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The advantage of Kunlunlong DC project is to break the two-point and one-line transmission mode and send Yunnan's hydropower to Liuzhou in Guangxi and Huizhou in Guangdong. The so-called multi-terminal DC transmission is like a water pipe connected to multiple taps. . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The 1,500-kilometer transmission line spans 15 times of railways, 273 times of roads, and 82 times of rivers. Each crossing is a challenge.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　Kunbei Converter Station is 1,100 kilometers east of Lixi Town, Yingde City, Qingyuan, Guangdong. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main stream of the Pearl River is between the two towers one kilometer apart. The river is 800 meters wide and becomes a scorpio. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to install tons of wires to a height of 100 meters? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yang Fan, the person in charge of the project construction, said that it was necessary to use hot air balloon leads, which is inefficient, and can now be done with drones. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yang Fan said: "Take a thin line to the other side of the river. Each tower will have a pulley like a pulley. The wire frame is on the pulley. We will pull the wire a little bit with a thin line and a thick line. Going to the other side of the river."
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　Long-distance power transmission, the loss of electrical energy is very amazing, UHV DC transmission is considered to be the best answer to solve this problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On January 8, 2018, the National Science and Technology Awards Conference was held in Beijing. The UHV ±800 kV DC transmission project won the 2017 National Science and Technology Progress Award.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　For more than 40 years, the West-East Power Transmission has enabled China's DC transmission technology to achieve a leap from zero to complete mastery of core technologies, and to overcome world-class problems such as insulation characteristics, electromagnetic environment, equipment development and test technology under extra-large current. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today, UHV DC transmission technology has become a business card for China and is recognized as the world's leading technology. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Kunliulong DC project integrates the most complex and cutting-edge grid technology, and the construction project has created many world firsts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the previous power is sitting on the "green leather train", it has already taken the "Revival". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Academician Li Lizhen also brought the Wudongde project to the international power grid conference. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Li Lizhen said: "We introduced this project at the meeting, which caused the international electrician community not only to pay attention, but also to be surprised. They kept asking us questions, and I kept explaining to them how we did it."
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　In 2021, the Kunliulong project will be completed and put into operation. At that time, Yunnan clean water and electricity will be transported to Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macao and Dawan District for 20 billion kWh per year, equivalent to one quarter of Shenzhen's annual electricity consumption. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The west and west sent east to “copy” the blue sky in the west to the coastal areas, supporting new changes in lifestyle and urban appearance.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　In 2018, Guangzhou City Public Transport entered the green and low-carbon “Electric Age” and more than 10,000 pure electric buses shuttled through the streets of the city. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The person in charge of providing charging services for these electric buses has calculated the accounts. He said that there are now more than 140 charging stations in the city. One car is about 200 degrees a day, and 10,000 cars is about 2 million degrees.　　
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　On July 18th, the load of China Southern Power Grid was the eighth highest this year. The data shows that in addition to the rapid increase in cooling load such as air-conditioning power, tens of thousands of high-end manufacturing enterprises gathered in Dawan District of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao are driving electricity. The important strength of growth, the resilience and vitality of the local economy are revealed.
