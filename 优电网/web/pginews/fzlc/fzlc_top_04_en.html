							<div class="article" id="artibody" style="text-indent:35px;">
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the evening of July 13th, local time, a large blackout in Manhattan, New York, and the iconic Empire State Building fell into the dark. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The power outage caused some subway lines to be suspended, traffic jams, more than 70,000 users were affected, and NBC and CNN could only broadcast programs by emergency generators.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Coincidentally, the 13th was the anniversary of the blackout in New York in 1977. The reason for the power outage was that lightning hit the substation.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The power outage test tested the ability of the US power supply company in New York and tested the level of city managers.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wang Chengshan, dean of the School of Electrical Automation and Information Engineering of Tianjin University and expert group of the key research and development plan for smart grids of the Ministry of Science and Technology, said, “Although I have not seen professional technical analysis reports, the number of users affected by power outages and power outages are analyzed. It should belong to the category of power outages in urban power distribution systems. Although the same scale of power outages in urban power grids has occurred, it is still unbelievable in the world economic centers such as New York, especially in important areas like Manhattan."</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Different from China's centralized operation and regulation mode, the US power grid is regulated by a number of independent operators. Under the premise of following the safety guidelines, each operator will use the market mechanism to pursue the maximization of power grid assets. When multiple operators want to maximize profits, When the power grid is in spite of accidental failure, it may be caused by poor coordination and the fault range is expanded, eventually becoming a large power outage.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Looking at China again, in the urban power grid area, there will be power outages in China. "But in terms of power outages that affect a wide range of large power grids, China has not happened in recent years." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, in the past 20 years, in order to improve the reliability of power supply to urban power grids, China's annual capital for urban power grid construction and transformation has reached nearly 100 billion yuan. The urban power grid equipment has been almost completely updated, and the flexibility of the urban network structure has been greatly improved. The measures are also more advanced, which are the reasons why Chinese urban residents 'have no power sense.'" Wang Chengshan introduced.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How is China's largest and interconnected large power grid built in China? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ku Shu today recommended a reminiscence article by Zhang Guobao, former director of the National Energy Administration, to witness the twists and turns of China's super power grid development.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Starting from the weak and broken "bad mess"</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The power industry in New China started from the backward, weak, and broken "bad mess" of old China.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When it was liberated in 1949, the installed capacity of the country was only 1.85 million kilowatts, which is only equivalent to the current two units.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2015, the national installed capacity reached 1.506673 billion kilowatts (not including the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and the Shaanxi Local Power Company's power supply area), which was 814 times that of 1949. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1949, the country's power generation was 4.9 billion kWh. In 2015, the power generation reached 5.55 trillion kWh, about 1133 times that of 1949.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before the reform and opening up, 330 kV was the highest voltage level of the power grid. Today, China has the world's highest voltage level of ±800 kV DC transmission and 1000 kV UHV AC transmission line.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first five-year plan implemented from 1953 to 1957, the power development target is an installed capacity of 2.05 million kilowatts, and the end of the power generation reached 15.9 billion kilowatt hours in 1957. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This goal is also equivalent to the level of two units today. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power unit built in China in 1952 was the Heilongjiang Fulaerji Thermal Power Plant, with a single unit capacity of only 25,000 kilowatts. The equipment was assisted by the Soviet Union.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After a generation, several generations have persisted in their struggles and efforts, and China has built the world's largest nationwide interconnected power grid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2015, China's power generation installed capacity reached 1.506 billion kilowatts, ranking first in the world, with the world's largest ultra-supercritical generator set with a single unit of more than 1 million kilowatts.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China's electric power industry started 80 years later than Western countries, and now it is a veritable world power power. This is a proud performance worthy of the Chinese people's pride, and it is also the result of the efforts of the majority of employees on the Chinese electric front.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reform and opening up have brought China's power technology to a new level</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since China implemented the reform and opening up policy in 1978, we have also seen our own gaps in contact with the power technology and equipment of developed countries. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the early 1980s, China has introduced a large number of advanced power generation equipment and technologies. Through digestion and absorption and innovation, China's power technology has taken a new step.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was at this time that I entered the work of the State Planning Commission, and in the mechanical and electronic bureau responsible for the technical introduction of machinery, and the introduction of almost all the technical introduction of power equipment, I have the opportunity to witness the technology introduction and localization work during this period.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that time, the country’s foreign exchange was in short supply, so the indicators for the use of each imported technology were subject to approval. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The foreign exchange indicators of all imported technologies were concentrated in the management of the Foreign Investment Division of the State Planning Commission. At that time, the Foreign Investment Department was responsible for the introduction of foreign exchange technology by Xie Yang. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The declaration and implementation of the introduced technology are the responsibility of the Ministry of Power Industry and the Ministry of Machinery Industry, and the State Planning Commission is responsible for final approval.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During this period, equipment manufacturing technologies related to power transmission and transformation have been introduced from transformers, high-voltage switches, surge arresters, oil-filled cables to insulation equipment and cable joints.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1981, through the complete purchase of foreign equipment and technology, China built the first 500 kV AC transmission line, from Pingdingshan in Henan to Wuchang in Hubei, to solve the power stability problem of the 1 m 7 rolling mill of Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1984, the first self-designed and constructed Yuanjin Liaohai 500 kV AC transmission line was built, and the Yuanbaoshan Power Plant arrived in Haicheng via Jinzhou and Liaoyang. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The equipment used in this line is almost the first batch of self-produced equipment imported by China, so the quality problems of oil-filled cable oil leakage and transformer oil leakage continue. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that time, the sulphur hexafluoride circuit breaker produced by the Pingdingshan high-voltage switch factory with imported technology also exploded.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1989, China's first ±500 kV DC transmission line - Gezhouba to Shanghai's Gehu DC was completed and put into use. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The equipment and technology of this line is a full set of products purchased from BBC. Later, BBC merged with Assia, which is now ABB. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China's ±500 kV and later ±800 kV UHV DC are developed on this basis.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is also a major technology introduction project in the power industry, which is to introduce 300,000 and 600,000 kilowatt generator sets from Westinghouse. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Previously, China's self-produced power generation equipment was a maximum of 125,000 kilowatts of dual-water internal cooling generators and 200,000 kilowatts of generators. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The units imported from Westinghouse have played an important role in the upgrading of China's power generation equipment.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Speaking of Westinghouse in the United States, this is a company that has provided important technology to China's power equipment. Of course, this company has gradually declined. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the reform and opening up, China has introduced 300,000 kilowatts and 600,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment technology from Westinghouse. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first supporting project was Shandong Shiheng 300,000 kilowatt power plant and Anhui Pingyi 600,000 kilowatt power plant. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The introduction of this technology has brought China's power generation equipment manufacturing technology to a new level. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now, the AP1000 three-generation nuclear power technology is also introduced from Westinghouse.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the early 1980s, in order to realize the localization of a number of major engineering projects, the State Council set up a major equipment office of the State Council, which was set up in the State Economic Commission, and was appointed as the office director by the deputy director of the State Economic Commission, Lin Zongqi. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Comrade Lin Zongqi was the designer of the Shanghai Heavy Machinery Plant's 10,000-ton hydraulic press under the leadership of Vice Minister Shen Hong. He later became the first aerospace minister.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is said that the State Council’s major equipment office was originally set up in the State Planning Commission, and later in the State Economic Commission, and the State Planning Commission as a member unit to participate in the work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am participating in the work of the State Council Major Equipment Office as a staff member of the State Planning Commission.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among the 12 major equipments initially identified, there are ±500 kV DC transmission lines from Gezhouba to Shanghai, 500 kV AC transmission and transformation equipment, Qinshan nuclear power plant equipment, Three Gorges engineering equipment and 300,000 kilowatts and 600,000 kilowatts. Power Equipment.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Step by step, build a national unified interconnection and mutual supply unified power grid</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before 1999, China's power grids were still in a state of non-linkage between the various regional power grids. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since then, the interconnection between Northeast Power Grid and North China Power Grid, Central China Power Grid and Northwest Power Grid has been completed, and the interconnection of Hainan Island with the Mainland and the supply of electricity from the Mainland to Hong Kong and Macao have been completed.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1999, I served as the deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, in charge of energy transportation infrastructure and industry, science and technology, etc. At that time, China had formed grids of joint ventures in Northeast, Northwest, North China, East China and South, but Shandong and Fujian. Sichuan (including Chongqing), Hainan and Xinjiang, and the Tibet Autonomous Region are independent power grids that are not connected to the surrounding provinces. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The grids of the northeast, northwest, north China, east China, and southern joint ventures, as well as the Sichuan-Chongqing power grid, are also disconnected. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are 11 grid systems installed above 2 million kilowatts.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the sparsely populated Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Region, the district is divided into several small local power grids. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, the Tibet Autonomous Region initially had only the Tibet-China power grid connected by Lhasa and Shigatse, and Linzhi, Changdu and Ali were independent small power grids. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Xinjiang, there are the Xinjiang Power Grid with Urumqi as the center and the South Xinjiang Power Grid with Korla as the center. The power grids in the Ili area west of Kuitun are not connected to each other. There are several independent small power grids in one area. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that time, it was far from forming a unified unified power grid for national interconnection, and each power grid managed its own affairs.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Looking further, there are so many small hydropower counties in the country that are under the control of the water conservancy department. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One year in Heilongjiang, there was a mass incident in a military industrial enterprise. Premier Zhu Rongji led a team to Heilongjiang. I also traveled as a member of the Central Delegation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the report of Heilongjiang Province, the difficulty of the forest area was specifically mentioned. I only know that the power grid department of the forest area is managed by the forestry department and is also an independent power grid. Later, the forestry was difficult, and there was no money to transform and develop the forestry power grid.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the Wenchuan Earthquake, I went back to the frontline command with Vice Premier Yu Liangyu to restore the power infrastructure. Only then did I know that the power grid in Aba Prefecture was called the animal husbandry power grid, which was controlled by the agricultural department and not by the power company.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the past two years when I debated the UHV issue, people who opposed the UHV emphasized the problem of hierarchical and hierarchical management. I sometimes wondered that when I was in charge of the energy transportation infrastructure in 1999, the grid was still so scattered and long. Hierarchical hierarchical management method?</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The situation at the time was independent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, the idea of ​​grid construction after I took office is to build these scattered and independent power grids into a unified large power grid that can be interconnected and exchanged across the country. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I am not sure if I can complete this task within my tenure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My idea is consistent with the idea of ​​the state power company at that time. In the national grid of the nationwide interconnection, we all cooperate and support each other.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1 Northeast Power Grid is connected with North China Power Grid</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, in May 2001, a 500-kilovolt AC line from Jiangxi Province to Jiangjiaying, Hebei Province was built, connecting the Northeast Power Grid to the North China Power Grid, and the Northeast Power Grid and North China Power Grid became a synchronous large power grid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the connection between the two major power grids by a 500 kV AC line was too fragile, so they were disconnected. A 500 kV DC back-to-back converter station was built in Gaoling to link the Northeast Power Grid and the North China Power Grid into an asynchronous grid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The location of Jizhong Power Plant in Northeast China Power Grid and North China Power Grid is very important.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2 Huazhong Power Grid is connected with Northwest Power Grid</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Lingbao Converter Station started construction in February 2003. On April 11, 2005, the DC system was successfully unlocked, realizing the networking of the Central China Power Grid and the Northwest Power Grid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In August 2005, Lingbao Converter Station was officially put into commercial operation.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The connection between the Central China Power Grid and the Northwest Power Grid is through the transmission line connecting Henan Lingbao to Linyi, Shaanxi. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The expansion project of Henan Lingbao back-to-back converter station in the northwest and Huazhong network was officially put into commercial operation on December 14, 2009.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In November 2013, a 500 kV DC transmission line from Shaanxi Baoji to Deyang, Sichuan was built, which connected the Northwest Power Grid to the Central China Power Grid and became an asynchronous grid. Sichuan Hydropower began to export to the northwest.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3 Central China Power Grid is connected with China Southern Power Grid</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to solve the problem of sending 10 million kilowatts of electricity to Guangdong, in August 2000, the construction of a 500 kV DC transmission project from the Three Gorges to Guangdong (Hubei Jingzhou to Huizhou Boluo Xiangshui Town), June 2004, Three Gorges to Guangdong ±500 Kilovolt DC is put into production. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Central China Power Grid and China Southern Power Grid have become interconnected asynchronous power grids.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4 Huazhong Power Grid is connected with Sichuan-Yunnan Power Grid</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Ertan Hydropower Station in Sichuan was hit by the Asian financial crisis. Due to this, the demand for electricity was at a low tide, and the hydropower of Ertan could not be effectively absorbed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The original power transmission plan of the Three Gorges Power Station was supplied by the Three Gorges to Chongqing. Due to the weak power, it was decided that the electricity of the Three Gorges Power Station would no longer be exported to Chongqing, but would be replaced by the power of Ertan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Later, the economy resumed rapid growth, the electricity load increased sharply, and Chongqing began to lack electricity. Chongqing Mayor Wang Hongju found me and blamed why the Three Gorges did not supply electricity to Chongqing.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the moment, and he is also a moment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to effectively absorb Ertan Power and Sichuan's hydropower during the flood season, it was decided to build a 30,000-line line, from the Three Gorges to Wanxian County in Chongqing, to build a 500 kV AC transmission line, and link the Sichuan-Yunnan Power Grid to the Central China Power Grid into a new one. Synchronization of Central China Power Grid.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5 Three Gorges Power Delivery</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Three Gorges Project is located in the central part of China. Its main function is to produce a large amount of clean electricity. It was a very valuable resource in the absence of electricity in China at that time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The provinces and cities around the Three Gorges are rushing to divide the electricity of the Three Gorges.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Initially, the scope of the Three Gorges substation included the westward transfer to Chongqing, and the rest was basically transported along the Yangtze River to Central China and East China, including Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first planned transmission to the East China Power Grid is the ±500 kV DC line of the Sanchang Line (Three Gorges Longquan to Changzhou Zhengping). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, there are three Shanghai lines (Yidu, Hubei to Huaqing Town, Qingpu, Shanghai).</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Later, according to the changes in the situation, in August 2000, the Beidaihe meeting decided to build the Sanguang line from Jingmen in Hubei to Boluo County in Huizhou, Guangdong. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, when the Three Gorges Project was completed, it coincided with the period of low electricity consumption. Many provinces and cities indicated that it was difficult to accept the power of the Three Gorges.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chongqing used to say that Chongqing made sacrifices for the Three Gorges immigrants and should be divided into three Gorges. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Later, Chongqing said that because of the tremendous contribution made to the Three Gorges immigrants, we cannot accept the electricity from the Three Gorges. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Chongqing area mainly consumes hydropower from the Ertan Hydropower Station in Sichuan.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Henan Province said that it is mainly based on thermal power and does not need electricity from the Three Gorges. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jiangxi said that it is a small agricultural province and does not need much electricity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anhui also said that it is an agricultural province, and there are two Huai coal mines, and it does not need electricity from the Three Gorges. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang have always accepted the electricity of the Three Gorges.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To this end, I asked the National Development and Reform Commission's Basic Industries Division to take the lead in the establishment of the Three Gorges Power Distribution Group to distribute the Three Gorges Power to the provinces and cities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the completion of the Three Gorges Project, the State formed the Three Gorges Project Acceptance Committee, which was divided into two parts: one part is the Three Gorges Project and the other part is the Three Gorges Power Transmission Project.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The National Three Gorges Power Transmission Engineering Acceptance Group was appointed as the head of the Development and Reform Commission, Ma Kai. I was the deputy director of energy and served as the deputy leader. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After more than a year of hard work by experts, the national acceptance of the Three Gorges Power Transmission Project was completed.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The electricity generated by the Three Gorges is very different between the wet season and the dry season. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the wet season, it can send nearly 20 million kilowatts of electricity, while in the dry season only 5.5 million kilowatts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To solve this huge gap in the flood season, it is necessary to build a coal-fired power generation of more than 10 million kilowatts in Hubei to balance it. However, during the flood season, the 10 million kilowatts of thermal power will be stopped again. This is very uneconomical, only Interoperability and mutual supply are the right way to solve problems.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">6 West Power East, the formation of China Southern Power Grid</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before the formation of China Southern Power Grid, it was called the Southern Associated Company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The power assets of Guangdong Province are mainly local assets of Guangdong Province and are not part of the State Power Corporation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Due to the rapid development of the economy of Guangdong Province, the lack of electricity is very serious and has become the norm. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Guangdong Electric Power previously invested in Tianshengqiao primary and secondary power stations, obtained a certain share of power, and is constructing a ±500 kV DC transmission line from Tianshengqiao to Guangzhou.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In August 2000, the Beidaihe Conference Central Committee decided to implement the West-East Power Transmission Project. During the 10th Five-Year Plan period, Yunnan and Guizhou sent 10 million kilowatts of electricity to Guangdong, and the large-scale South Passage West-East Power Transmission Project started. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the "five major battles", the task of sending 10 million kilowatts to Guangdong was completed ahead of schedule.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the completion of the "five major battles", the total transmission capacity of China Southern Power Grid Corporation's West Power to Guangdong reached 10.88 million kilowatts. By September 2004, all the power grid projects of the "Five Major Campaigns" had been successfully completed, 15 months earlier than originally planned. In the power system reform, China Southern Power Grid was formed.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7 North China and Huazhong Power Grid are connected to form a two-synchronous grid</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">State Grid Corporation proposed to build a 1000 kV UHV AC transmission line from Shanxi's southeastern Shanxi to Jingmen, Hubei, so that North China Power Grid and Central China Power Grid will be connected into a synchronous large power grid, and then form the Sanhua Synchronous Power Grid in North China, Central China and East China. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the advantages of this is that the thermal power in North China can be sent to Central China during the dry season, while the hydropower stations in the Three Gorges and Sichuan hydropower stations in Central China can be sent to North China during the flood season.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the construction of a 1000 kV UHV AC transmission project has caused controversy. Some people oppose the construction of a 1000 kV UHV AC transmission project from Jindongnan to Jingmen, Hubei, and oppose the formation of Sanhua Synchronous Power Grid.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, after repeated argumentation, the National Development and Reform Commission approved the construction of a 1000 kV UHV AC transmission line from Shanxi's southeastern Shanxi to Jingmen, Hubei. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, North China Power Grid and Central China Power Grid have formed a synchronous large power grid, but the connection between North China Power Grid and Central China Power Grid is still not strong enough with only one 1000 kV UHV.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">8 Construction of Qinghai-Tibet Network Project</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the construction of a ±400 kV DC transmission line from Qinghai Golmud to Lhasa, Tibet, Tibet Power Grid is connected to the Northwest Power Grid and no longer becomes an isolated network.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Qinghai-Tibet network project has been repeatedly demonstrated and considered. I have been to Tibet many times because of working relationships. The first time I went to Tibet Manla Hydropower Station. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Due to the special geographical environment of Tibet, Tibet has always maintained a clean energy power market. There are no coal-fired power stations and only a few emergency fuel units.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When building the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, I considered that after the completion of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, it was possible to transport coal from the northwest to Tibet after the completion of the railway. Is it possible to consider building a coal-fired power station in Nagqu? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, considering it over and over again, it is better to maintain Tibet's clean energy power. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, the Tibetan Plateau has thin air and the output of thermal power plants has been affected. The idea of ​​building a coal-fired power plant in Naqu has also been abandoned.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, due to the poor season of hydropower generation, Tibet is dominated by hydropower, with no problems during the wet season and severe power shortage during the dry season. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have mobilized China Resources Power to dismantle the fuel gas units built in Guangdong to Tibet to support Tibet's power construction. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the power generation cost of the fuel power station is extremely high. The annual power subsidy for Tibet is very large. Even Li Benzhen, the deputy director of the Tibet Autonomous Region Development and Reform Commission in charge of electricity, proposed that Tibet invest in power plants in Anhui and other places as a subsidy for Tibet's electricity.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the completion of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, Tibet's economic and social development has accelerated, and the problem of power shortage is more serious, especially in the dry season. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After repeated argumentation, it is still necessary to build a Qinghai-Tibet interconnection project to solve the power supply problem in Tibet once and for all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the dry season, the northwest power grid supplies electricity to Tibet; in the wet season, if hydropower is further developed in Tibet in the future, there will be surplus power to supply electricity to the northwest.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the Qinghai-Tibet network project has been questioned by some experts who have never been to Tibet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They believe that the cost of the Qinghai-Tibet network is too high and advocates the construction of oil-fired units in Tibet. There is no need to build a Qinghai-Tibet network project.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finally, we negotiated with the State Grid Corporation and decided to build a Qinghai-Tibet network project. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">State Grid Corporation is very supportive of the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet interconnection project. In the long run, State Grid Corporation recommends the construction of ±500 kV transmission and transformation lines.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But a new problem has happened. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Xu Yongsheng, director of the National Energy Administration's power department, listened to some people's opinions and thought that the construction capacity of ±500 kV is too large. It is not necessary. It is recommended to reduce the voltage level and use 400 kV DC transmission. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this way, the National Energy Administration and the State Grid Corporation have had differences of opinion on what kind of voltage level to build, and they have been deadlocked for some time.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finally, I negotiated with Comrade Liu Zhenya. He said that in order to build the Qinghai-Tibet network project as soon as possible, the State Grid Corporation made concessions and built a ±400 kV DC transmission line according to the opinions of the Energy Bureau. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After five years of demonstration, the Qinghai-Tibet networking project has landed in the controversy.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">9 Linking Xinjiang Power Grid to Northwest Power Grid</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before the reform of the power system, the State Grid Corporation had not yet been established. Zhang Xiaolu, the director of the Science and Technology Department of the State Power Corporation, was a student of my postgraduate class. I reported to me that I would upgrade the 330 kV high voltage of the Northwest Power Grid to 750 kV. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have questioned whether the voltage level is too much?</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, in view of the 330 kV transmission line in the northwest, the construction of 500 kV or 1000 kV transmission lines is not appropriate, and it is agreed to upgrade the Northwest Power Grid to a 750 kV high-voltage transmission network. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On July 22, 2010, the Wutuha 750 kV transmission project was completed. At the end of the year, the 750 kV transmission line from Hami to Gansu Yongdeng was completed, and the Northwest Power Grid was connected to the Xinjiang Power Grid.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">10 The internal grid of the Tibet Autonomous Region is connected</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Tibet Power Grid was originally developed from the two most important cities in Tibet, Lhasa and Shigatse. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1950, the central government initially deployed personnel from the Chongqing power sector to help Tibet build electricity. The Lhasa and Shigatse regions gradually connected to the Tibet-China power grid, and the Shannan region was also connected to the Tibet-China power grid.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When I went to Tibet, the Linzhi area, the Qamdo area and the Ali area were too small and were independent small power grids. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Later, using the opportunity of rural network transformation, the Lhasa and Nyingchi power grids were connected to form the Tibet-China power grid, which is the most important population and economic concentration in Tibet, such as Lhasa, Shigatse, Shannan and Nyingchi. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, due to the remoteness of the Qamdo area and the Ali area, it is still an independent small power grid.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">11 Power Network in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first is to link the Urumqi region and the Korla region of southern Xinjiang into a power grid. The power grid in the Ili region is still independent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Later, through the construction of the Chabuqi Seawater Conservancy Project and the Jilintai Hydropower Station, the transmission line was built from Kuitun to the Ili area, forming a unified grid for interconnection and interconnection in Xinjiang.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">12 Hainan Island and the mainland network</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hainan Island was originally an island power grid and was not connected to Guangdong. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The power system reform established the China Southern Power Grid. The coverage of China Southern Power Grid is Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong and Hainan.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Later, Comrade Wang Xiaofeng, then secretary of the Hainan Provincial Party Committee, called Comrade Zeng Peiyan to say that our Hainan Island is an independent power grid. There is no substantive significance to enter the Southern Power Grid. Unless Hainan Island and Guangdong Power Grid are connected, it can truly integrate into China Southern Power Grid. .</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Comrade Zeng Peiyan promised to build a submarine cable from Zhanjiang to Hainan Haikou after the establishment of the Southern Power Grid, and physically connect Hainan with the Southern Power Grid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the establishment of China Southern Power Grid, the company promised that although the cost is high, it will still build a 500-kilovolt submarine transmission line from Guangdong to Hainan. At present, the capacity is not very large, only 600,000 kilowatts, but Hainan Power Grid is connected with China Southern Power Grid. In addition to Taiwan Island, all provinces across the country form a unified and unified power grid.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On July 23, 2015, the second 500 kV cross-sea exchange network project of China Southern Power Grid and Hainan Power Grid was officially approved by the National Development and Reform Commission. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the completion of the second network project, the networked transmission capacity will reach 1.2 million kilowatts. Solving the problem of “large and small network” of Hainan Power Grid will help improve the safety and economic performance of Changjiang Nuclear Power Plant and the safe and reliable operation capability of Hainan Power Grid.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">13 Shandong, Fujian and other independent power grids are integrated into the large power grid</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Due to the rapid economic development and insufficient power in Shandong, the Wangqu Power Station built in Shanxi supplied power to the Shandong point network. Later, the 660 kV DC transmission line from Ningxia Ningdong to Shandong Qingdao was built. The Shandong Power Grid has been integrated into the North China Power Grid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fujian Province is connected to the Zhejiang Power Grid and integrated into the East China Power Grid.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">14 Jinshajiang Hydropower Base Power Transmission</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Jinsha River originates from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and flows into Yunnan Province. It is called the middle reaches of the Jinsha River in Yunnan Province. The lower reaches of the Jinsha River are the boundary rivers of Yunnan Province and Sichuan Province. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the lower reaches of the Jinsha River, there are four large hydropower stations, namely Xiangjiaba, Xiluodu, Baihetan and Wudongyu. The combined installed capacity is close to the two Three Gorges and is an important hydropower base in China.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the Jinsha River hydropower development plan was planned, the power system has not been reformed and unified by the Ministry of Water and Power. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, when the construction of the Jinsha River hydropower base began, two grid companies, the State Grid Corporation and the China Southern Power Grid Corporation, have been formed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">State Grid Corporation hopes that hydropower in the lower reaches of the Jinsha River will be fully absorbed by the State Grid Corporation, while Yunnan Province and China Southern Power Grid Corporation believe that Yunnan Power has been allocated to the Southern Power Grid, and the power of the generators on the Jinsha River in Yunnan Province should be It is delivered to Yunnan Province and China Southern Power Grid.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I convinced Comrade Liu Zhenya that according to this plan, the right bank of the Jinsha River was sent to the East China region through the construction of the upward DC (Xiangjiaba to Shanghai Fengxian); the power supply on the left bank of the Jinsha River was sent to the Guangdong region by the Southern Power Grid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Upward DC is the first 800 kV UHV DC line built in China. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Later, Brazil built the beautiful mountain hydropower station, and the power was exported to the Rio de Janeiro region. Its installed capacity and transmission distance are very close to the upward DC.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I invited the Brazilian Minister of Energy to visit the DC and accompany him to visit the Shanghai Fengxian Substation, which aroused his interest. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After several inspections, it was determined to adopt China's ±800 kV UHV DC technology. In the subsequent bidding, State Grid Corporation won unremitting efforts to invest in the construction of the beautiful mountain hydropower station in Brazil to Rio de Janeiro ±800 kV DC transmission line. project.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">15 mainland power supply to Hong Kong and Macao</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As early as the construction of the Daya Bay nuclear power plant, Hong Kong's China Light and Power was one of the major shareholders, and a large part of the power of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station was sent to Hong Kong. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The completion of the Daya Bay nuclear power plant has enabled electricity supply to Hong Kong, but there are still about 6 million kilowatts of coal-fired power plants in Hong Kong.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The size of Hong Kong is small, coal-fired power plants not only have emissions problems, but also coal mining yards and solid waste. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When Mr. Donald Tsang was the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Mr. Yau Tenghua was the Director of the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Bureau. At that time, their environmental awareness was very strong. There were plans to phase out the coal-fired power plants in Hong Kong. Mr. Yau Teng-hua has repeatedly looked for me, hoping to increase the purchase of electricity from the mainland. , gradually phase out coal-fired power plants in Hong Kong.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In connection with my work, first, Hong Kong is worried that the supply of natural gas from Hainan’s Yinggehai submarine pipeline will gradually decrease. It is hoped that through the West-East Gas Pipeline, the natural gas pipeline from Shenzhen to Hong Kong will be extended, and the annual supply of gas to Hong Kong will be 1 billion. Cubic meters; the second requirement is to supply electricity to Hong Kong.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that time, the Liaison Group for Infrastructure Construction in Mainland China and Hong Kong and Macao was established. I am responsible for the mainland and Hong Kong is Mr. Donald Tsang. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On August 28, 2008, I was entrusted by the Central Government and the Chief Executive of Donald Tsang to sign the Memorandum of Understanding on Gas Supply and Power Issues in Hong Kong. The content is a 20-year gas supply and power supply agreement to Hong Kong.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Taking into account the interests of Hong Kong investors and considering the existing model of Daya Bay and Lingao, I also verbally promised to find a nuclear power plant site in Guangdong Yuedong area, initially in the Shanwei area of ​​Shantou, and welcome Hong Kong to adopt a similar approach to Daya Bay. The investment method jointly invests in the construction of a nuclear power plant that supplies electricity to Hong Kong.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Macao is mainly a fuel generator set, and its installed capacity is much smaller than that of Hong Kong. They have always been positive about purchasing electricity from the mainland. At that time, they had indicated that they could consider giving up all fuel power generation, and all of them would buy electricity from the mainland. .</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">16 mainland and Taiwan networking issues</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Taiwan has no energy resources. Taiwan's power generation mainly depends on fuel, gas and coal. At the same time, there are three nuclear power plants. Taiwan's quad-core problem has been stranded because of political disputes between the two parties. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although the nuclear waste generated by three existing nuclear power plants in Taiwan is small, it is stored in a small island called Lanyu. The design reserves are already full, but because Taiwan does not have nuclear waste treatment facilities, it has been looking for solutions.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The sound of opposing nuclear power plants on Taiwan Island is still very large. In fact, solving the power supply problem on Taiwan Island is not complicated from a technical perspective. The distance from Pingtan in Fujian to Hsinchu in Taiwan is only about 140 kilometers, which is not longer than the submarine cable in Hainan Island. Too much, so it is completely achievable to supply electricity from Taiwan to the island through submarine cables. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The current problem is not a technical issue or a political issue. It is not difficult to do so as long as there is a willingness of the Taiwan side.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">National network still regrets</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When I retired from the position of the Energy Bureau in early 2011, I realized the interconnection of the national grid in China, but I also left some regrets.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, as two economically developed provinces along the coast, Fujian and Guangdong have not been able to achieve networking. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to solve the power supply problem in Guangdong, I proposed the connection between Fujian Power Grid and Guangdong Power Grid. However, due to the reform of the power system, the State Grid Corporation and China Southern Power Grid Corporation were formed. Fujian Power belongs to the State Grid Corporation, and Guangdong Power belongs to China Southern Power Grid. the company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The problem of grid connection between the two provinces was put on hold.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the perspective of the province, Fujian Province is more active, and Guangdong Province is not very motivated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the State Grid and the South Network Company are central enterprises. As long as the government makes up its mind, it is not difficult to realize the networking between Fujian and Guangdong.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Second, power supply has been realized between other regional power grids. However, only high-voltage power transmission between North China and East China Power Grid has not been connected, and cross-region power supply has not been realized.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This problem can only be solved by future generations, but I think it will be solved sooner or later, just like the Ningxi Railway.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Looking back at the development of China's power grid, I am filled with emotion. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now on the vast land, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from the roof of the world to Hainan Island on the coast of the South China Sea is covered by an interconnected power grid. This is really a great century project.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are going to Tibet now, at night, the Barkhor Street in Lhasa is brightly lit, and it is no different from the big cities in the mainland. It is really proud of the achievements of our country to see the old power grids of some developed countries.</font></font></p>
