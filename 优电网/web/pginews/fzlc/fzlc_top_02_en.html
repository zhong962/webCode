								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The 2019 anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is a crucial year for the completion of a well-off society. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the new year, what kind of starting point and what kind of style will China's power industry start?</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For a long time, people used to use the "barometer" to describe the relationship between power operation and economic development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, China's GDP grew by 6.6% year-on-year, and the national economy remained in a reasonable range. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, the national total electricity consumption increased by 8.5% year-on-year, and the growth rate reached a new high since 2012. The elasticity of power consumption exceeded 1.1 for the first time in recent years, reaching 1.29. The electricity consumption between industries continued to differentiate and the electrification level accelerated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The overall steady, steady and positive economic growth trend supports the rapid growth of power demand.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Looking forward to the national electricity demand in 2019, industry institutions and experts predict that the growth rate of electricity consumption will fall steadily. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Considering the international and domestic situation, industrial operation and local development, and the impact of high base in 2018, in the case of Pingshui Year and no large-scale extreme temperature impact, China Electricity Council predicts that the total social power consumption will increase by about 5.5% in 2019. .</font></font></p>
								
								<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Economic restructuring has given birth to new kinetic energy</font></font></h3>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Analyze the electricity consumption data in 2018. In 2018, the national total electricity consumption was 6.84 trillion kWh, an increase of 8.5%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among them, the first industry used 72.8 billion kWh of electricity, up 9.8% year-on-year; the second industry used 47.235 billion kWh, up 7.2% year-on-year; the tertiary industry used 108.1 billion kWh, up 12.7% year-on-year; The electricity consumption of urban and rural residents was 968.5 billion kWh, a year-on-year increase of 10.4%.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Statistics show that the growth rate of electricity consumption in the secondary industry is the highest in the past seven years, driving the growth of electricity consumption in the whole society by 5.0 percentage points, which plays a decisive role in the growth of electricity consumption, of which the electricity consumption in the manufacturing industry increased by 7.2%.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of industry classification, the electricity consumption of high-tech and equipment manufacturing industry increased by 9.5% year-on-year; the electricity consumption of the four high-energy industries increased by 6.1%, which was lower than that of the whole society; the electricity consumption of consumer goods manufacturing increased by 5.5. %, which coincides with the slowdown in the growth of total retail sales of consumer goods.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the added value of China's high-tech manufacturing and equipment manufacturing industry increased by 11.7% and 8.1% respectively in 2018, which was higher than the growth rate of 6.2% of industrial added value above designated size, reflecting the transformation and upgrading of industrial structure. New kinetic energy growth is taking shape.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The third industry has the fastest growth rate of electricity consumption. Since 2016, it has maintained double-digit growth rate for three consecutive years, driving the whole society to increase electricity consumption by 1.9 percentage points. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, in 2018, the added value of China's service industry increased by 7.6% year-on-year, 1.8 percentage points faster than the secondary industry, accounting for 52.2% of GDP, and contributing 59.7% to national economic growth.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">While serving the role of “stabilizer” for economic growth, the service industry has also brought new growth points for electricity consumption. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As an important driving force for the steady growth of the tertiary industry, the annual production index of the information transmission, software and information technology service industry increased by 37.0% year-on-year, driving the service industry's total index to increase by 3.0 percentage points, and its electricity consumption increased by 23.5% year-on-year. The Internet and related services, software and information technology services are growing at more than 60%, demonstrating the strong momentum of the emerging services industry.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The growth rate of urban and rural residents' electricity consumption reached double digits again, and the growth rate increased by 2.6 percentage points year-on-year, which drove the whole society's electricity consumption to increase by 1.4 percentage points. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The rapid growth of residents' electricity consumption is a combination of China's urbanization rate and the continuous improvement of the electrification level of urban and rural residents, as well as the temperature, the new round of rural network transformation and upgrading, and the vigorous promotion of residents' heating “coal to electricity”. The internal drive of rising income levels and consumption levels.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics show that the contribution rate of final consumption expenditure to economic growth in 2018 is 76.2%, an increase of 18.6 percentage points over 2017. Consumption continues to be the first driving force for economic growth, and consumption transformation continues to advance, and consumption is upgrading. obvious.</font></font></p>
								
								<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Continuous optimization and upgrading of power consumption structure</font></font></h3>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the perspective of power consumption structure, the proportion of electricity consumption in the secondary industry in the whole industry in 2018 was 69.0%, which was 0.8 percentage points lower than that in 2017. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among them, the proportion of electricity consumption in the four high-energy industries decreased by 0.6 percentage points compared with 2017; the proportion of electricity used in high-tech and equipment manufacturing increased by 0.1 percentage points. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The proportion of electricity consumption in the tertiary industry and urban and rural residents increased by 0.6 and 0.2 percentage points respectively. The proportion of electricity consumption in the primary industry was the same as that in 2017, and the power consumption structure continued to be optimized.</font></font></p>
								
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2019 is the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China. It is the key year for the first 100-year goal of building a well-off society. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recently, the party secretary and director of the National Bureau of Statistics, Ning Jizhen, published a signed article in the magazine Qiushi. The current economic operation is stable and changeable, the external environment is more complicated and severe, and the domestic long-term and short-term issues are intertwined.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The China Electricity Council predicts that the growth rate of electricity consumption in the whole society will fall steadily in 2019, and the total electricity consumption in the whole society is expected to increase by about 5.5%.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The increase in electricity consumption to 8.5% in 2018 is a combination of factors. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The person in charge of the relevant departments of the China Electricity Council said that in 2018, the growth rate of electricity consumption exceeded the GDP growth rate, and the elasticity coefficient exceeded 1. At the same time, electricity as the most important secondary energy, the proportion of terminal energy consumption increased, and the terminal consumption was clean. The embodiment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The new round of power system reform, including the reduction of general industrial and commercial electricity prices, has also spurred the enthusiasm of the entire society, including residents.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the deepening of the structural reform of the supply side, the three major battles will start well, and the high-quality development effect will gradually emerge. The impact of industrial restructuring on the power consumption of the whole society will be deepened, and the proportion of the tertiary industry and residents' electricity consumption will continue. improve.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to China Electricity Council's "2018~2019 National Electricity Supply and Demand Situation Analysis and Forecast Report", the national electricity supply and demand situation in 2018 has changed from the overall easing in the previous years to the overall balance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among them, the overall supply and demand of electricity in North China, East China, Central China and South China is balanced. The local and staged power supply in some provinces is tight; the power supply capacity in the northeast and northwest regions is surplus. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The top three power-consuming provinces in Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shandong all exceeded the 600 billion kWh mark, and the total electricity consumption was about 185.53 billion kWh, accounting for nearly 30% of the total electricity consumption.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China Electricity Council expects that the nation's electricity supply and demand will maintain an overall balance in 2019, and electricity supply and demand in some areas will be tight. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among them, the regional and time-based power supply and demand in North China and Central China are tight; the overall balance of power supply and demand in East China; the overall balance of power supply and demand in the southern region, Guangxi and Guizhou in the dry season, and the pressure on clean energy in Yunnan during the flood season; northeast and northwest The region is expected to have a surplus of power supply capacity.</font></font></p>
