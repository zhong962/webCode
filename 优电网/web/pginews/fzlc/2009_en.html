										by Press: In the past 100 years, the world has always revolved around the development of electricity and increase transmission capacity and reduce transmission costs the themes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The emergence of new technologies and the demand for energy from economic growth are the engines of this development process. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to meet the rapid growth of power load and realize long-distance and large-capacity power transmission, many countries in the world such as the United States, Japan, Russia, Canada and Brazil began to explore the UHV transmission technology in the 1960s. Some UHV transmission lines have been established. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is China's situation in this regard? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This paper introduces in detail the status and level of China's position in this field through the introduction of the world's first commercialized UHV exchange demonstration project built in China.
									</font></font></font>
								</p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; □ China Quality Reporter Du Fu </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									On December 30, 2008, China’s first 645-kilometer UHV AC pilot demonstration project began operation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As of mid-March this year, through this demonstration project, an average of 20 million kilowatt-hours of electricity was delivered to the Central China Power Grid every day, and the total power transmission has reached 1.676 billion kWh.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone familiar with the situation knows that it is a high-quality management and product that holds up this special demonstration project.</font></font></p>
								<p align="center"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Exciting breakthrough</font></font></strong></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									This project, which began in 2006, is also called the National Grid Southeast-Nanyang-Jingmen UHV AC Pilot Demonstration Project (hereinafter referred to as the UHV Demonstration Project). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Its starting point is Changzhi, Shanxi, and it reaches the Jingmen of Hubei Province through Nanyang, Henan. It is the world's first power transmission and transformation project with the highest voltage level, the highest technical level and the strongest transmission capacity. It is also the world's first commercial high-voltage operation. The line, through this channel, can transfer electricity from Shanxi to Guangzhou, Shanghai and other places.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									"In China, there are projects that truly have independent research and innovation and can be called great. There are, but not many. The demonstration project that has just been put into operation can be said to be a veritable and great independent innovation project. It fills the gap. The gap in the development of the world's power grid technology." Lu Qiang, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, expressed his congratulations on the UHV project with his emotional vocabulary.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									High-voltage transmission lines are common in our lives. High voltage refers to voltages from 10 kV to 500 kV, while UHV refers to voltages of 1000 kV. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the line that carries high voltage is likened to an ordinary road, UHV is the high-speed road for transmission. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Its biggest feature is long-distance, large-capacity power transmission. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shu Yinyu, deputy general manager of State Grid Corporation, introduced that the State Grid has comprehensively compared the economic indicators of natural power, cost, and transmission corridors to the AC transmission scheme. The conclusion is: the longer the transmission line, the larger the transmission capacity, the more UHV transmission is used. economic.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									Lu Qiang said that although Russia, Japan and other countries have done relevant research, they have not really built a commercial operation of UHV transmission projects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China is the only country that actually runs the UHV test demonstration project.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									Through the construction of this UHV test demonstration project, China has achieved a series of major independent innovation achievements in the field of energy basic research and electric power construction: the key technologies of UHV core have made comprehensive breakthroughs; equipment development has achieved the goal of independent innovation of localization goals and The international competitiveness has been significantly improved; the experimental research capability has reached the world's leading level, and it has world-class high-pressure test conditions; a relatively complete UHV standard system has been established, which has created conditions for the application of UHV technology.
								</font></font></p>
								<p align="center"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It’s hard to be</font></font></strong></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China's development of UHV has identified a road to independent innovation and localization from the very beginning.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									Based on this confidence, in 2005, the State Grid first proposed the idea of ​​building a “cross-region, large-capacity, long-distance, low-loss UHV backbone network”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is an ambitious project for the imbalance of China's energy distribution and economic development.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									It is understood that most of China's energy resources are in the west, while electricity demand is concentrated in the east. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The existing power grid is mainly based on 500 kV AC and positive and negative 500 kV DC systems. The farthest power transmission distance is 500 km, which severely restricts the power transmission capacity and scale. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The UHV grid can reach a distance of 1000 km to 1500 km, which can better meet the demand for electricity in economic development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the completion of the UHV power grid, it can reduce the installed capacity of power generation by 20 million kilowatts, reduce the coal consumption of power generation by 20 million tons per year, and achieve an annual comprehensive power saving benefit of more than 100 billion kilowatt hours.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									But sending 1,000 kilovolts of current from Shanxi to Hubei is not an easy task. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Because the situation at the time was: First, the core technology could not be bought, and second, there was no place to buy. In the 30 years of reform and opening up, China’s economic strength, technical strength, and especially the equipment manufacturing industry have greatly improved. Give us confidence," Shu Yin said.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									After the national UHV AC transmission technology was approved by the state, the State Grid immediately organized the China Electric Power Research Institute, the Wuhan High Voltage Research Institute and the China Electric Power Consultancy Group Company, and invested in the research on UHV transmission technology, and completed the exchange of UHV transmission projects. The electromagnetic environment and its impact on the ecological environment and other important issues.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									In terms of the UHV electromagnetic environment that has received much attention, UHV transmission has proposed electromagnetic environmental control indicators in line with national standards. On July 13, 2005, it also passed the expert review organized by the former State Environmental Protection Administration. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, important progress has been made in research work on UHV system demonstration, UHV transmission technology economy, and UHV transmission and transformation design technology.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									In October 2006, the State Grid first established the UHV AC transmission technology test base in Wuhan, and all the bases used domestic equipment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In February 2007, at this test site, the first 1000 kV current was sent to this test circuit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today, when this test circuit became a demonstration project for real commercial operation, Vice President Du Xiangyu of the Chinese Academy of Engineering concluded: "This is the world's number one, and it has driven a series of core technologies related to power transmission and power transformation. Manufacturing industry, such as the development of circuit materials and other technological innovations, an innovation in the industrial chain. After the completion of this incident, China's international voice in this field, including its core competitiveness, has greatly increased."
								</font></font></p>
								<p align="center"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The right to speak" will not come</font></font></strong></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									Localized equipment is also being carried out at the same time as the UHV transmission technology. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the case of foreign technology blockade, what is the situation of China's machinery industry? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Can it be manufactured to meet the needs of UHV transmission equipment in insulation coordination, high altitude areas, lightning protection facilities, etc.?
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									To this end, the China Machinery Industry Association federation has repeatedly discussed the UHV organization and proposed an implementation plan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the end of March 2005, the State Grid Corporation and the China Machinery Industry Association jointly organized more than 30 senior experts, and conducted two surveys on 12 major power transmission and transformation equipment manufacturers in China. The overall conclusion was: domestic line equipment, Transmission and transformation equipment such as transformers and high-voltage reactor manufacturing capabilities, switchgear, etc. have already met the basic conditions for the development of UHV equipment, and can be localized in the UHV demonstration project.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									Yang Yongjian is the chief engineer of the State Grid Academy of Sciences. There is a document in his computer that records the list of companies that provide equipment for the UHV demonstration project in the country. All 51 companies are from China. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some of these devices, including transformers, were pioneered in China. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These domestically produced equipments have been tested and debugged by the test base and are put into use after gradually meeting the technical requirements.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									Opposite the Wuhan UHV test base, there is also a particularly eye-catching base: the first 500 kV substation built in China 30 years ago, and all the equipment used in this substation is imported. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On some devices, you can now see signs from foreign companies such as Japan, France, and Switzerland. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After 30 years, the huge contrast is that all UHV equipment has been domestically produced. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today, as we move along this technology, we find that all technical logos are written with the names of Chinese manufacturers.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									UHV transmission can be said to be the Everest Mountain of the world power grid technology. China's UHV transmission has enabled us to climb the peak of this world technology. While mastering the UHV transmission technology, we have realized the independent development and production of UHV transmission equipment. It has achieved the world-class UHV test capability, and more importantly, it has established a relatively complete UHV transmission technology standard system.
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									Zhou Xiaoxin, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering who participated in or presided over the research on key technologies of China's large-scale EHV transmission system engineering, said: "Before this, there was no real UHV commercial line in the world, so the world did not work out. A set of standards. After a commercial pilot project in China is put into production, a standard system is needed to guide the design of the circuit, including the manufacture of equipment and the future operation of the system, because this is the world’s first commercial operation. The standard, so it is possible to become an international standard."
								</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									The series of achievements made by the UHV project has aroused widespread concern. In this field, for the first time, China has shaken off the role of following and chasing, and realized the transformation of Chinese manufacturing to China, and won the equipment manufacturing industry in China. The right to speak on the same stage as the world-class level.
