		<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　The 40-year reform of China's economic system has achieved remarkable results, and China's power reform is complicated and long. China's power reform is not based on the introduction of the State Council's Document No. 5 in 2002 and the departure of the former State Power Corporation from the historical stage. Since the establishment of the company, it has been 21 years.</font></font></p>
		<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　From 1988, the national electric power construction was undertaken by the former Ministry of Electric Power or the former Ministry of Water Resources and Hydropower, to the process of China's reform and opening up, to promote the reform of the market economy, to form a power industry company, to explore the separation of government and enterprises and the reform of the market management system, and then to the former state power in 1997. The company was formally established and operated by the former Ministry of Electric Power. The key to power reform is to respect the national conditions and the natural laws of the power industry, and follow the incremental reform concept, especially from the power generation side and the power sales side to promote the power market reform. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the future, the development of competitive business will be the only way for the development of power grid enterprises. To find a correct positioning, clear direction and promote practice, it is necessary to correctly understand and analyze the current situation, especially to grasp the new trend of the energy industry in China's economic reform and development. Grasp the new connotation of the reform of the power system and grasp the new situation of state-owned enterprises and state-owned assets reform.</font></font></p>
		<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　At present, China's electricity consumption has entered a new stage of medium-speed growth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is a major issue facing the current power industry to properly resolve the remaining problems since the supply-side structural reform and promote the transformation and upgrading of power development and improve quality and efficiency. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As early as 2014, the Party Central Committee and the State Council attached great importance to the development of the power industry. For the first time, they proposed the "four revolutions and one cooperation" of energy development, namely: promoting the energy consumption revolution, suppressing irrational energy consumption; promoting the energy supply revolution and establishing pluralism. Supply system; promote the energy technology revolution, promote industrial upgrading; promote the energy system revolution, open up the fast track of energy development; comprehensively strengthen international cooperation and achieve energy security under open conditions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2016, the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration issued the “13th Five-Year Plan for Energy Development”, which clarified the main tone of green development and accelerated the process of transforming and upgrading China's power industry into a modern energy system.</font></font></p>
		<p><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">New energy and multiple sources complement each other to promote new integrated energy suppliers</font></font></strong></p>
		<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　The energy revolution is the construction program of modern intelligent power systems. The "four revolutions, one cooperation" new energy security strategy guides China into a new era of energy production and supply. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of energy production, the proportion of new energy sources has gradually increased, and the importance of clean energy has become more prominent. The single energy monopoly has gradually been replaced by multiple energy production. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of energy supply, diversified supply systems including coal, oil, gas, nuclear, and new energy sources are gradually formed. Centralized long-distance energy supply begins to gradually integrate with distributed energy, and energy consumption will gradually become a development direction.</font></font></p>
		<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　Compared with the traditional centralized energy supply mode, the distributed energy supply adopts small-scale, small-capacity, modular, and decentralized arrangement in the vicinity of users, and independently inputs electric, hot, and cold energy supply systems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The gas cooling and heating triple supply system uses gas as a primary energy source for power generation, and uses the waste heat generated after power generation to perform cooling or heating, and outputs a distributed energy supply of electric energy and heat (cold) to the user through the cascade utilization of the gas. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The amount of heat consumed by a distributed energy system that consumes the same unit of gas is three times that of a conventional treatment (boiler, etc.). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, the diversified supply also embodies the concept of smart energy. In addition to the collection of multiple energy sources, it also integrates various forms of energy supply such as traditional power grid, rooftop photovoltaic, geothermal heat pump and distributed energy “triple supply” system, greatly improving energy efficiency. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It can be said that system integration capability is becoming the core technology competitiveness of energy companies.</font></font></p>
		<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　In addition to the multi-source complementarity in the horizontal direction, the new energy industry chain of “source-network-load-storage coordination” in vertical service is also beginning to take shape. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The development of energy Internet provides unlimited possibilities for the integration of energy production and integrated energy services. The management and profit model of traditional power companies are being challenged. Power grid enterprises must give full play to the core ties of the power grid, focus on the entire energy industry, and appropriately extend the industry. Chain, in the future development to seize the opportunity.</font></font></p>
		<p><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Distribution network multi-network integration competition business new space is promising</font></font></strong></p>
		<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　Actively promoting the energy revolution and providing safe, economic, clean and sustainable power supply and supporting services for the development of the national economy has always been an important mission for the future development of power grid enterprises. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the dual pressures of overcapacity and environmental hard constraints, energy technology innovation is driving the global energy consumption into a new stage while promoting energy supply upgrades. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main driving force for power consumption is shifting from the traditional secondary industry to the emerging industry, service industry and domestic energy consumption. The demand side management and electric vehicle business have broad development space and the energy consumption pattern is more diversified.</font></font></p>
		<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　In this situation, the single city service network has shown the weakness of low efficiency, high cost, and limited service functions. The traditional grid “independent operations” will be replaced by “cooperative operations” in cooperation with other urban infrastructure networks. Multi-table collection and multi-network integration will be the development direction of the power industry to expand the competition business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the past, water, electricity, gas, and hot city services were separated. The water metering, metering, and settlement services of the water supply group, the gas group, the power group, and the heating group caused a lot of waste of manpower and financial resources, and also reduced consumption. The experience of the person. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Due to the basic position of the power grid in the urban pipe network, along with the expansion of the distribution network competition business, the development space of the power grid enterprise is still broad. An important direction is to develop water, electricity, gas and heat in the information integration. Collecting and copying, the development of TV, telecommunications, power grid and Internet "multi-network integration" on the physical carrier. At the same time, due to the basic role of the power grid and economies of scale, we must always "take me as the main" to compete in this integration. Business, open up space for efficiency.</font></font></p>
		<p><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The intelligent high-tech of urban power grid is the commanding height of future development</font></font></strong></p>
		<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　With the rise of the fourth industrial revolution, we are entering the Internet age. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, mobile Internet, and blockchain technologies are widely used in all walks of life. The "Internet +" technology and concepts gradually influence and reshape the traditional industrial industry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The integration of the Internet, the Internet of Things, the energy Internet, and the smart grid is an opportunity and challenge provided by the new technology revolution, and it also points to another direction for energy companies to conduct competitive business.</font></font></p>
		<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　The energy industry chain and the Internet can be deeply integrated, and actively adapt to the trend of the era of energy supply, distribution and utilization from the traditional centralized to intelligent decentralization. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Power grid enterprises can provide comprehensive energy services that are more adaptable to the modern mobile Internet lifestyle, study the role of power big data in household energy reports, financial services, value-added services, power forecasting, consulting, etc., and play an important role of smart grids in smart cities. On this basis, explore the establishment of a new business model of openness and sharing, and shape the new industry format.</font></font></p>
		<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　Especially for the development of smart grids, we must continue to increase investment in science and technology innovation, and focus on a number of key technologies with broad prospects but limited core technologies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Further improve and improve the industrial system innovation system, focus on improving the level of autonomy in equipment manufacturing, and promote new achievements in power systems in new energy, new materials, smart equipment, electric vehicles, energy storage technologies, and next-generation information industries. More Chinese manufacturing and China's leadership will drive China's power industry to achieve a new leap.</font></font></p>
