									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Compared with photovoltaics, wind power started early, but the development slowed down. After the new installed capacity reached 31.39 million kilowatts in 2015, the development speed dropped, but it rebounded in 2018. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, wind power installed capacity of 21 million kilowatts, an increase of 3.55 million kilowatts compared with the same period of last year, an increase of 20.3%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Photovoltaic is completely different. Since the official statistics in 2009, PV has developed rapidly. The annual increase exceeds wind power in 2016. The gap in 2017 is even greater. In 2018, the newly installed solar power generation capacity was 44.73 million kilowatts, which was less than the same period last year. It was 8.68 million kilowatts, down 16.2% year-on-year. Although the growth rate has slowed down, it is still more than twice the installed capacity of wind power.</font></font><br></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the downturn in 2017, nuclear power increased its installed capacity in 2008 to a rapid recovery of 8.84 million kilowatts, an increase of 6.66 million kilowatts compared with the same period of the previous year, an increase of 306.3%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan, China’s nuclear power new approval project was cautious and cautious, and no public approval information was obtained for three consecutive years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of the scale of new production, 2017 has entered the bottom of recent years, and the newly added capacity in 2018 has reached a peak of nearly ten years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The new capacity comes from the addition of seven new commercial nuclear power units in 2018, including the first batch of AP1000 and EPR. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the China Nuclear Energy Industry Association, as of the end of 2018, China has a total of 44 nuclear power generating units in operation, with an installed installed capacity of 44,456,160 kilowatts, ranking third in the world (excluding nuclear power information in Taiwan). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are 11 units under construction with an installed capacity of 12.18 million kilowatts.</font></font></p><p><img data-echo="http://img01.mybjx.net/news/UploadFile/201904/6368970459479644773419059.png" src="http://img01.mybjx.net/news/UploadFile/201904/6368970459479644773419059.png" title="11.png" alt="11.png"></p><p><img data-echo="http://img01.mybjx.net/news/UploadFile/201904/6368970460303291885374876.png" src="http://img01.mybjx.net/news/UploadFile/201904/6368970460303291885374876.png" title="12.png" alt="12.png"></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The new installed capacity of thermal power continues to shrink, but the absolute value still accounts for the weight. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thermal power installed capacity increased by 41.19 million kilowatts a year, a decrease of 3.35 million kilowatts compared with the same period of the previous year, a year-on-year decrease of 7.5%. The absolute value of the increase is still slightly lower than solar power generation, continuing the first time in 2017 that the installed capacity of solar power is lower than that of solar power. .</font></font><br></p><p><img data-echo="http://img01.mybjx.net/news/UploadFile/201904/6368970461187942484042012.png" src="http://img.mybjx.net/theme/default/wap/images/loading.gif" title="13.png" alt="13.png"></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, hydropower installed a new installed capacity of 8.54 million kilowatts, a decrease of 4.33 million kilowatts compared with the previous year, a year-on-year decrease of 33.7%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the "11th Five-Year Plan", China's hydropower has continued to maintain a relatively fast production rate. After 2007, the annual output of production is above 10 million kilowatts, with a new peak of 39.96 million kilowatts in 2013. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, due to the impact of the amount of construction and the intensity of production, the new installed capacity of hydropower has shown a downward trend since 2013, and reached its lowest point in 2018. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the plan, the hydropower installation target for 2020 is 380 million kilowatts, and there is a gap of about 30 million kilowatts. It is necessary to put into production more than 15 million kilowatts per year to achieve the goal.</font></font><br></p><p><img data-echo="http://img01.mybjx.net/news/UploadFile/201904/6368970462816935654941087.png" src="http://img.mybjx.net/theme/default/wap/images/loading.gif" title="14.png" alt="14.png"></p><p><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Third, the power supply and demand situation turned into an overall balance, power generation equipment utilization hours rebound</font></font></strong><br></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, the cumulative average utilization hours of power generation equipment for power plants of 6000 kW and above nationwide was 3,862 hours, an increase of 73 hours over the same period last year. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the average utilization hours, except for the slight increase in the average utilization hours of power generation equipment under economic stimulus in 2010 and 2011, the other years showed a downward trend. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Beginning in 2015, the average utilization hours of power generation equipment in the country began to fall within 4,000 hours, and the overcapacity situation appeared. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the downturn has seen new changes in 2018, and the power supply and demand situation has shifted from overall easing to overall balance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, with the adjustment of production capacity, the utilization hours have slightly rebounded, and the effect of supply-side reform and restructuring has been reflected.</font></font></p><p><img data-echo="http://img01.mybjx.net/news/UploadFile/201904/6368970464249617596115580.png" src="http://img.mybjx.net/theme/default/wap/images/loading.gif" title="15.png" alt="15.png"></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the power supply, in 2018, the national thermal power equipment utilization hours were 4361 hours, an increase of 143 hours year-on-year, the highest level since 2015, and the utilization hours increased for three consecutive years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reasons for the analysis are mainly due to the multiple factors such as the increase in electricity consumption in the whole society and the de-capacity of coal-fired power. The relationship between supply and demand is improving, and the utilization hours of thermal power generation equipment are increasing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the acceleration of the structural optimization of thermal power industry in China, the growth rate of thermal power installed capacity will further slow down, and the average utilization rate of thermal power equipment in China will be in a stable range.</font></font><br></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, the average utilization hours of hydropower equipment increased slightly, to 3,613 hours, an increase of 16 hours compared with the same period of last year, ranking the top three in the past ten years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the National Energy Administration, in 2018, China's water abandonment was about 69.1 billion kWh, and the water abandonment rate was 5%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the case that the incoming water is better than the previous year, the national average water energy utilization rate is about 95%.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The average utilization hours of nuclear power equipment continued to rise slightly, but there was a gap of nearly 700 hours from the high point of nearly ten years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, the annual utilization hours of nuclear power was 7184 hours, up 95 hours year-on-year, and still operated for more than 7000 hours. It is reported that the Hongyanhe nuclear power station and the Fangchenggang nuclear power plant, which were affected by the elimination of previous years, have reached the average utilization hours in 2018. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, from the data of the past ten years, the utilization hours of nuclear power have shown a downward trend. The number of hours of utilization of more than 7,700 hours has been maintained until 2015, and the highest point in 2007 was 7,874 hours. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was a significant decline in 2015, and it fell sharply to 7060 hours in 2016, with a slight rebound in the last two years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the deepening of market-oriented reforms, the participation of nuclear power is deepening, and the utilization hours of nuclear power may rebound in the trend of consumption.</font></font></p><p><img data-echo="http://img01.mybjx.net/news/UploadFile/201904/6368970465156069448483010.png" src="http://img.mybjx.net/theme/default/wap/images/loading.gif" title="16.png" alt="16.png"></p>
