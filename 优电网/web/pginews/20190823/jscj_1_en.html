									<p>In the context of increasing infrastructure investment, power grid engineering investment has gained new momentum. Recently, the National Energy Administration issued the "Notice on Accelerating the Planning and Construction of a Batch of Key Transmission and Transformation Projects", which will approve 9 key transmission and transformation lines in this year and next, including Qinghai to Henan, Shaanxi to Hubei, and Zhang. From Xi'an to Ya'an, Yazhong to Jiangxi, Baihetan to Jiangsu, Baihetan to Zhejiang, Nanyang-Jingmen-Changsha and other 7 UHV lines. The project includes 12 UHV projects with a total transmission capacity of 57 million kilowatts. This is another construction peak after the large-scale planning and construction of UHV in 2012.</p>

									<p>From the perspective of route planning and layout, this round of UHV and Yungui intercom projects and the Guangdong-Guangzhou networking project will facilitate the absorption of wind and light resources in Qinghai and Zhangbei, and facilitate the delivery of water and electricity to Yunnan, Sichuan and Guizhou. From the current situation of strengthening the integration of new energy into the grid and the growth of electricity consumption in the receiving area, it is inevitable to speed up the construction of the transmission channel of the power grid.</p>
									<p>From this perspective, new energy grids, including hydropower, wind power, and photovoltaics, are in line with the interests of power grid companies. At present, the attitude of power grid companies to new energy sources is no longer resisted, opposed, or even called "junk power" in the past, and the interests are increasingly consistent. In the new energy consumption, the power grid can increase investment in power engineering. After the last round of approval, UHV ushered in a new pattern.</p>

									<h3>China UHV Transmission Project</h3>
									<p>China's research on UHV transmission technology began in the 1980s. After more than 20 years of hard work, it has achieved a number of important scientific research results. Studies have shown that the development of UHV transmission is an inevitable choice for the development of China's power industry. At present, the State Grid has been under construction and UHV AC power transmission and transformation projects: one is the mid-line project of Shaanxi-Jindong-Nanyang-Jingmen-Wuhan, and the other is the east line project of Huainan-Weinan-Zhebei-Shanghai. In addition, China's third UHV transmission project, “Sichuan-Shanghai ±800 kV UHV DC Transmission Demonstration Project”, was also started on December 21, 2007 in Yibin County, Sichuan Province. By 2020, China's UHV power grid will be basically completed, and the transmission capacity will reach 200 million kWh or more, accounting for 25% of the country's total installed capacity.</p>
									<p>On January 6, 2009, China's independent research and development, design and construction of 1000 kV AC transmission and transformation project with independent intellectual property rights - Jindongnan-Nanyang-Jingmen UHV AC pilot demonstration project successfully passed the trial operation. This indicates that China has made major breakthroughs in the long-distance, large-capacity, low-loss UHV core technology and equipment localization, and is of great significance for optimizing energy resource allocation and ensuring national energy security and reliable supply of electricity.</p>
									<p>The UHV AC line, which is in operation for the first time in the world, has a total length of 640 kilometers. The voltage level is the highest in the world, reaching 1000 kV. The electric energy delivered is five times that of the existing 500 kV. The floor area can be saved by more than half, and the investment in the entire project is one-third less than the 500 kV line. It spans the three provinces of Shanxi, Henan and Hubei, and it also includes two large spans of the Yellow River and Han River. The line starts from the Shanxi 1000kV Jindongnan Substation, and passes through the Henan 1000kV Nanyang Switch Station and ends at the 1000kV Jingmen Substation in Hubei.</p>
									<p>The project was approved by the National Development and Reform Commission in August 2006. It was started at the end of the year, completed in December 2008, completed on December 30, and commissioned for commissioning. At 22:00 on January 6, 2009 The 168-hour trial run was put into commercial operation and the operation is in good condition.</p>
									<p>On December 15, 2015, the world's first ultra-high-voltage direct current transmission project of 10 million kilowatts - Ximeng-Taizhou ± 800 kV UHV DC transmission project started in Xinghua. The project is an important part of the National Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan “Four Interchanges and Four Straight” UHV projects, which are scheduled to be completed and put into operation in 2017.</p>
