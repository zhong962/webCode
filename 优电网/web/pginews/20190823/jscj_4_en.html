                 <p>
                 	<strong>1. Distribution of wind energy resources in China</strong>
                 </p>
                 <p>　　China belongs to the mid-latitude region of the northern hemisphere. Under the influence of atmospheric circulation, it is controlled by the sub-polar low-pressure zone, the subtropical high-pressure zone and the equatorial low-pressure zone. The northern part of China is mainly affected by the westerly zone at the mid-high latitudes. The northeast trade wind belt of latitude is affected.</p>
                 <p>　　China's vast territory, the southernmost latitude of the land is about 18 degrees north latitude, the northernmost latitude is about 53 degrees north latitude, the north and south land spans 35 latitudes, and the east and west spans 60 longitudes. China's unique macro geographical location and microtopography determine the characteristics of China's wind energy resources distribution. China is geographically the largest continental plate in the world - the eastern part of Eurasia, the world's largest ocean - the Pacific Ocean, the thermal difference between sea and land is very large, the northern and southern regions are subject to continental and The maritime climate interacts and the monsoon phenomenon is obvious. The north is characterized by a temperate monsoon climate. The winter is affected by the dry cold airflow from the mainland. It is cold and dry, and the summer is warm and humid. The south is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate. In the summer, it is affected by the warm and humid air current from the ocean.</p>
				 <p>	According to the distance between land and sea, China can be divided into southern coastal areas, southeast coastal areas, eastern coastal areas, central inland areas, western, northern and northeastern inland areas.</p>
				 <p>　　Under the influence of the northeast coastal wind belt and the summer hot low pressure, the main wind direction is the easterly wind and the northeast wind. Because the atmospheric pressure gradient is weak in summer, the wind is not large and the wind energy is small.</p>
                 <p>　　The southeastern coastal area and Taiwan Island form a unique narrow-tube effect in the Taiwan Strait, and the area is in the northeast trade wind belt. The main wind direction is consistent with the Taiwan Strait. Therefore, the wind is accelerating in the area, the wind is increasing, and the wind energy is increased. Rich in resources, with good wind energy development value.</p>
                 <p>　　The eastern coastal area is basically under the control of subtropical high, and the pressure gradient is small. At the same time, the area is affected by the maritime climate. The duration of the strong wind is short and unstable, and the development potential of wind energy resources is general.</p>
                 <p>　　Due to the geographical location of the central inland area, cold air from the north is difficult to reach in winter, and the summer weather is less affected by the maritime climate. At the same time, due to the complex topography and large variation of the surface roughness, it is not conducive to The acceleration of the airflow makes the wind energy resources relatively scarce.</p>
                 <p>　　The western, northern and northeastern inland areas mainly include Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, northwestern Shanxi, northwestern Shaanxi and northern Hebei. These regions have high latitude and are controlled by the westerly belt, while the winter is affected by the northern high-pressure cold air mass. The main wind direction is west wind and northwest wind. The wind intensity is large and the duration is long. At the same time, the altitude of these areas is higher and the wind energy attenuation is small. Therefore, it has better wind energy development value.</p>
                 <p>　　China's observation and research work on wind energy resources began in the 1970s. The China Meteorological Administration conducted two national wind energy resources surveys in the late 1970s and the late 1980s, using the measured data of more than 900 meteorological stations across the country. The amount of wind energy resources on the 10m level from the ground is out of the country. According to the data, at that time, the total reserves of wind energy resources in China were 3.226 billion kW, the actual land development capacity was 253 million kW, and the wind energy reserves that can be developed and utilized in the offshore waters were 750 million kW.</p>
                 <p>　　According to the latest national wind energy resource survey organized by the China Meteorological Administration in 2004-2006, the original calculation results were corrected and recalculated using observation data of more than 2,000 meteorological stations nationwide for nearly 30 years. It shows that the total wind energy reserves that can be developed in China are about 4.35 billion kW, among which the onshore wind energy reserves that can be developed and utilized are 6 to 1 billion kW, and the offshore wind energy reserves are 1 to 200 million kW, totaling about 7-1 to 1200 kW.</p>
                 <p>　　
                 	<strong>2. China's main wind energy-rich area</strong>
                 </p>
                 <p>Figure 1 shows the distribution of effective wind energy density in China, and the dark color shows the distribution of wind-enriched areas.</p>
                 <p style="text-align: center;">　　<img src="http://www.chinapower.com.cn/u/cms/www/201608/25112648n2rp.jpg" data-bd-imgshare-binded="1"></p><p style="text-align: center;">　　Figure 1 China's effective wind energy density distribution map (W/m2)</p>
                 <p>　　(1) “Three North” (Northeast, North China, Northwest) Wind Energy Belt</p>
                 <p>The area includes nearly 300 kilometers wide areas in the three provinces of Northeast China, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Qinghai, Tibet, Xinjiang, etc. It is a rich wind energy belt. The area where the wind farm can be set up is flat, convenient, and has no destructive wind speed. It is the largest wind energy resource area in China, suitable for large-scale development and utilization.</p>
                 <p>　　(2) Wind energy rich belt in the southeast coastal areas</p>
                 <p>　　The cold air in winter and spring and the typhoon in summer and autumn can affect the coastal areas and islands in the region. It is one of the best wind energy belts in China. The annual effective wind power density is above 200W/m2, such as Taishan, Pingtan and Dongshan. In Nanlu, Dachen, Handan, Nan'ao, Mazu, Magong, Dongsha and other areas, the annual available hours are about 7,000 to 8,000 hours. The southeast coast stretches from the coast to the inland hills, and the wind-rich areas are only within 50 kilometers of the coast.</p>
                 <p>　　(3) Inland local wind energy-rich areas</p>
                 <p>　　In addition to the two wind energy-rich zones, the annual effective wind power density in local areas is generally below 100 W/m2, and the available hours are less than 3000 hours. However, in some areas, due to the influence of lakes and special terrain, it may also become a region rich in wind energy.</p>
                 <p>　　(4) Wind energy development zone with higher altitude</p>
                 <p>　　The hinterland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is also one of the relatively abundant areas of wind energy resources. In addition, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in the southwestern region of China has an altitude of more than 3,000 meters, and wind resources are also abundant. However, the main problems faced by these areas are complex terrain, limited by roads and transportation conditions, and difficult construction. In addition, the altitude is high, the air density is small, the number of wind turbines that can meet the characteristics of wind conditions at high altitudes is small, and so on. Difficulties in development.</p>
                 <p>　　(5) Offshore wind energy enrichment area</p>
                 <p>　　The wind speed at sea is high, and there is very little static wind period, which can effectively utilize the wind turbine generating capacity. It is generally estimated that the wind speed at sea is 20% higher than that on the plain, and the power generation is increased by 70%. The wind turbine with a design life of 20 years on land can be 25 to 30 years at sea. China's offshore wind energy-rich areas are mainly concentrated in the southern coast of Zhejiang, the coastal areas of Fujian and the eastern coastal areas of Guangdong. These areas are rich in wind resources and close to the power load center. They are compatible with the development of offshore wind power, but have the characteristics of high power generation. .</p>
                 <p>　　In December 2009, the China Meteorological Administration officially announced that the national wind energy resources detailed investigation stage results in a potential development of about 2.38 billion kilowatts on the land 50m height, and installed capacity of about 200 million kilowatts in the offshore 5-25m water depth line.</p>
                 <p>　　
                 	<strong> 3. Meteorological conditions affecting the distribution of wind energy resources in China</strong>
                 </p>
                 <p>　　(1) Cold air activity</p>
				 <p>　　In winter (December to February), the entire Asian continent is completely controlled by Mongolian high pressure. Its central location is in the northwestern part of Mongolia. From Mongolian high pressure, there is a small amount of cold air going south and entering China, as well as mobile high pressure. From time to time south, the temperature is low, forming a wide range of winds and cool weather.</p>
				 <p>　　As shown in Figure 2, there are five sources of cold air affecting China, and the route that invades China from these five sources is called a path. The first route comes from the Arctic Ocean surface near the east of Xindi Island. It enters the western part of Mongolia from the northwest and then moves eastward and southward to affect China. The second one is from the northwestern icy surface of Xindi Island, and enters China through Russia and Mongolia. The source originates from the Mediterranean Sea, and moves eastward to the western part of Mongolia to affect China. The fourth is from the ocean surface near the Taimeier Peninsula, moving south to Mongolia, and then to the southeast to influence China; the fifth is from Lake Baikal. The eastern Siberia region of Edom enters the northeast and north China regions.</p>
                 <p style="text-align: center;">
                 	<img src="http://www.chinapower.com.cn/u/cms/www/201608/25112648n2rp.jpg" data-bd-imgshare-binded="1">
                 </p>
                 <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2 China cold wave cold air path map</p>
                 <p>　　After entering the country, these five paths are divided into two different paths. One is through the Hetao, North China, and Central China. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River enter the sea, sometimes invading the South China region. The cold wave that invades along this path can affect most parts of China. More than 60% of the total number of times, cold air passes through the place has continuous strong winds, cooling, and often accompanied by sand. The other is through the northern part of North China and the northeast plain, the cold air path moves eastward into the Sea of ​​Japan, and some of it moves southwest into the two lakes basins through the lower reaches of the North China and Yellow Rivers. This number of occurrences accounts for about 40% of the number of times. It often makes the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea. The northeast winds in the East China Sea have also brought a wide range of strong winds, snowfall and low temperature to the north of the Yangtze River.</p>
                 <p>　　(2) Tropical cyclone activity</p>
                 <p>　　Temperature conditions are also an important factor to consider in the construction of wind farms. The operating conditions of the generator set, the performance of the components, and the maintainability of the unit will change at low temperatures. For example, as the temperature decreases, the air density will increase, which may cause overloading of the wind turbine. Generally, the fatigue limit of metal materials decreases with the decrease of temperature, and many major components have low temperature fatigue problems in the cold environment, especially The weld seam is easy to be brittle and broken; the function of electronic and electrical components is also affected by temperature; some types of wind turbines in normal operation, such as temperature below -20 degrees, wind speed exceeds the rated value, will produce irregular blade instantaneous vibration The phenomenon can lead to a rapid increase in the vibration of the unit, affecting the normal power generation of the unit, which causes the unit to stop, and may also cause damage to the blade. In addition, the oil used in wind turbines becomes very poor at low temperatures, making the unit difficult to operate, thereby jeopardizing the safe operation of the equipment.</p>
				 <p>　　here are 7 typhoons landing in China every year, and Guangdong has a maximum of 3.5 typhoons per year, followed by Hainan with 2.1 times, Taiwan 1.9 times, and Fujian 1.6 times. Guangxi, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Tianjin, and Liaoning total only 1.7 times, it can be seen that the area affected by the typhoon is decreasing from south to north.</p>
                 <p>　　<strong>4. Severe weather affecting wind energy utilization</strong></p>
                 <p>　　(1) Typhoon</p>
                 <p>　　The typhoon has the characteristics of warm high humidity and strong convergence. It is very energetic and fierce. It is often accompanied by strong winds such as squally winds, heavy rains and storm surges. It is one of the major disastrous weather systems affecting China. When the typhoon moves closer to the coast, the gusty wind can cause a large range of sea tides, causing the coastal areas to be violently impacted. The violent storms brought by the typhoon often cause serious damage to the ground facilities such as buildings and transmission lines. It poses a great threat to the wind turbine impellers exposed to the atmosphere and powered by natural winds. Damage, heavy damage caused by blade damage or even tower overturning.</p>
                 <p>　　(2) low temperature</p>
                 <p>　　Temperature conditions are also an important factor to consider in the construction of wind farms. The operating conditions of the generator set, the performance of the components, and the maintainability of the unit will change at low temperatures. For example, as the temperature decreases, the air density will increase, which may cause overloading of the wind turbine. Generally, the fatigue limit of metal materials decreases with the decrease of temperature, and many major components have low temperature fatigue problems in the cold environment, especially The weld seam is easy to be brittle and broken; the function of electronic and electrical components is also affected by temperature; some types of wind turbines in normal operation, such as temperature below -20 degrees, wind speed exceeds the rated value, will produce irregular blade instantaneous vibration The phenomenon can lead to a rapid increase in the vibration of the unit, affecting the normal power generation of the unit, which causes the unit to stop, and may also cause damage to the blade. In addition, the oil used in wind turbines becomes very poor at low temperatures, making the unit difficult to operate, thereby jeopardizing the safe operation of the equipment.</p>
                 <p>　　(3) ice accretion</p>
                 <p>　　Ice accretion refers to the phenomenon of ice formation on the surface of objects such as ground trees and facilities, also known as ice coating. Ice accretion has great harm to wind farms and wire lines, which not only increases the vertical load of wires and rods, but also increases the interface between wires and rods, thereby increasing the windshield area of ​​the mechanism and making wind loads. In addition, in areas with severe ice accumulation, accidents such as wire jumps, twists or even breaks or structural collapses may occur.</p>
                 <p>　　(4) Thunderstorm</p>
                 <p>　　Thunderstorms are lightning phenomena that occur during the intense development phase of cumulonimbus. When thunderstorms transit, meteorological elements and weather changes are very intense, often accompanied by strong winds, heavy rains, hail and tornadoes. It is a local but very violent disastrous weather. Because wind turbines and electric lines are built in open areas, they are in the atmospheric electric field formed by thunderstorm clouds. Compared with the surrounding environment, they are often a prominent target. It is easy to generate tip discharge and be hit by lightning. The huge energy released by lightning. Will cause damage to the wind turbine blade, the insulation breakdown of the generator, the burning of the control components, etc., causing serious damage to the equipment and lines. Even if it is not directly hit by lightning, it may cause high amplitude lightning voltage due to static electricity and electromagnetic induction. Waves, and generate a certain amount of mine current in the terminal, causing different degrees of harm.</p>
                 <p>　　(5) Sandstorm</p>
                 <p>　　Sandstorm is a weather phenomenon in which strong winds blow a large amount of sand on the ground into the air to make the air turbid and the visibility is less than 1km. The strong sandstorm is a weather phenomenon in which the air is very turbid and the horizontal visibility is less than 500m.</p>
                 <p>　　When a sandstorm occurs, it is often violent, the yellow sand is rolling, the sky is covered, the sky is yellowish, even reddish yellow, the sunlight is dim, the visibility is very low, and when it is serious, even the fingers are not visible, strong winds can blow down or pull up the trees, Electric poles, which cut off transmission lines and destroy buildings and ground facilities, cause human and livestock casualties and great destructive power.</p>
                 <p>　　For wind farms, the dangers of sandstorms are multifaceted. First of all, sandstorms are accompanied by strong winds. Strong sandstorms have reached 8 or more winds, and some even reach 12, which is equivalent to the wind of typhoon landing. The destructive power of winds on wind farms is self-evident. Secondly, the sand and the size of the soybeans and the large stones of the walnuts will hit and abrade the surface of the building and other exposed objects, which will not only cause severe wear on the surface of the wind turbine blades, but also cause the surface of the blades to appear. The uneven pits affect the output of the wind turbine, and at the same time seriously damage the strength and toughness of the blade surface and the overall strength of the blade, posing a greater hazard to the wind farm equipment. In addition, when the dust storm moves forward in the direction of the sea, it also drives the sand in the lower layer to move forward together. When it encounters the wind and the uplifted terrain, the sandstorm can cause different degrees of erosion on the soil, and each time the wind erosion depth Up to 1~10cm; when encountering the terrain or obstacles of the leeward, the large amount of sand and dust coming with the wind will cause sand burial, and the serious sand burial depth can reach more than 1m.</p>
                 <p>　　If the wind farm is built on a windward slope or a high-lying area, the erosion of the land by sandstorms will affect the firmness of the tower. In the leeward slope or low-lying areas, the sand burial can make the tower The height changes and affects the absorption and conversion of wind energy.</p>
