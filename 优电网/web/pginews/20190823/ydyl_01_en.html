									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the beginning of July, the Sukkenari Hydropower Project in Pakistan entered a small peak period of construction. More than 4,000 builders from China and Pakistan were working on the site day and night. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first hydropower projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project not only trained thousands of Pakistani skilled workers, but also solved one-fifth of the power gap in Pakistan after the completion of the project, benefiting the Pakistani people.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the construction site of the dam of the Suk Khanari Hydropower Station, a row of punching machines is drilling into the ground around the clock. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Workers should rush the dam-proof wall of 126 meters deep before August 15 to lay a solid foundation for the next dam closure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhang Dejian, the person in charge of the quality of the dam seepage prevention wall, told the reporter: "The depth of the seepage prevention wall is the biggest problem. In China, only the power station in Tibet has more than 120 meters of cut-off wall. Other power stations are not so deep. Impervious wall. Due to the uncertainty of geological conditions, in the process of drilling, it is necessary to drill while filling some bentonite mud and loess mud to ensure that the seepage wall does not collapse."</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Sujik Nari Hydropower Project is the largest hydropower project invested by China Gezhouba Group in Pakistan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The project invested US$1.962 billion and started construction on December 31, 2016. After two and a half years of preparation and construction, the current project progress has reached more than 35% of the total. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hydropower project manager Deng Siwen said: "Since the second half of last year, the spillway was excavated, and the construction of the seepage prevention wall, the diversion tunnel, the underground powerhouse and the tailwater tunnel were excavated, and 30 working faces were opened. At present, it has entered a small construction peak period. The Chinese personnel of the whole project have invested close to 800 people, and the Pakistani personnel have invested more than 3,800 people."</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deng Siwen said that many Pakistani employees did not master any skills of hydropower stations at the beginning of recruitment, and they could only do some of the simplest physical activities. However, after the hands-on training of Chinese builders, many Pakistani employees gradually grew into welders and steel workers. Some skilled workers, such as pouring workers and ironclad workers, also undertake management duties such as taking classes and working group leaders. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, one-tenth of the Pakistani employees working at the Suki Knari Hydropower Station have worked in the Nirum Jerum Hydropower Station in Pakistan, which was built by the Gezhouba Group in China. They grow into professionals who can be independent.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The electric team captain Zhong Wei is responsible for the installation and commissioning of the medium and high voltage equipment of the Suki Knari Hydropower Station, the line erection, the power supply of the first and the tail of the hydropower station, and the maintenance of large equipment. It manages about 100 Pakistani employees. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since 9 years ago, he has cultivated many outstanding Pakistani employees in the work of the Nirum Jerum Hydropower Station. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the Sukheknauri hydropower station started, he took his 16 Pakistani apprentices to a new position.</font></font></p>		
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhong Rong said: "In addition to words and deeds, I will also draw some power maps, teach them the skills of work, and combine the written knowledge with the work on hand to interact and interact at work. For example, after I teach a skill, I will One-on-one assessment, if the previous grasp is not enough, we must further strengthen the training."</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bilal Grani is a leader among the disciples of Zhong Rong. He has been working with Zhong Rong for 9 years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the Nirum Jerum Hydropower Station to the Sukuk Nari Hydropower Station, he grew up from a graduate student in electrical automation to a technical backbone of a hydropower project, specializing in generator repair and commissioning, even by identifying generators. The abnormal sound and the color of the gas discharged from the exhaust pipe can determine the location of the generator failure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Currently, Bilal Grani leads a team of 12 people who are grateful for the teacher's development.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Granny said: "Our team is like a family. Pakistani and Chinese work together and get along very well. Mr. Zhong is both my teacher and my friend. He taught me a lot and taught me how to work. I I also taught the learned technology to my team. Now everyone is doing very well."</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Sukink Nari Hydropower Project is scheduled to be completed on December 31, 2022. The hydropower station will install four impact-type hydroelectric generating units with a single unit capacity of 221 MW, with a total installed capacity of 884 MW and an annual generating capacity of 3.221 billion kWh. It accounts for 7.5% of Pakistan's hydropower generation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Upon completion, it will solve one-fifth of the power gap in Pakistan.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bilar Khan, senior business manager of the hydropower project, told reporters that these Chinese people came to Pakistan, improved infrastructure, solved the power shortage problem, and did a lot of things for the Pakistani people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He heard his father tell the story of China-Pakistan friendship from an early age, so when the opportunity comes, he must fight side by side with them. "Pakistan suffers from a power shortage. Industry is the backbone of every country, but currently in Karachi, Lahore, Most of the factories were sluggish due to lack of electricity, or closed down. The total installed capacity of the hydropower project reached 884 MW, which will bring huge power to Pakistan."</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to Deng Siwen, during the peak period of hydropower project construction next year, the number of employed Pakistani employees will reach more than 6,000, which will play an important role in solving local employment and improving people's livelihood.</font></font></p>
