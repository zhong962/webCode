According to the data of the China Electricity Council, 16 of the 25 power generation groups have realized Decline, 8 households rose slightly, and 1 remained flat.</font></font><br></p><p><img data-echo="http://img01.mybjx.net/news/UploadFile/201904/6368970477243860824412544.png" src="http://img01.mybjx.net/news/UploadFile/201904/6368970477243860824412544.png" title="26.png" alt="26.png"></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China's coal-fired power plants have achieved good results in ultra-low emission conversion. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the statistics of the China Electricity Council, from 2012 to 2017, in the case of a 30% increase in the installed capacity of coal power in the country, the emission of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and soot decreased by 86%, 89% and 85%. . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The standard coal consumption for coal-fired power plants has dropped from 325 g/kWh to 312 g/kWh. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to this calculation, in 2017, about 83 million tons of raw coal was saved. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As of the end of the third quarter of 2018, China's coal-fired power plants have completed ultra-low emission reforms of more than 700 million kilowatts, and exceeded the total target of 580 million kilowatts in advance, and the newly built ultra-low emission coal-fired generating units have achieved ultra-low emission in China. The limit coal-fired power units have reached more than 750 million kilowatts, accounting for more than 75% of all coal-fired power plants; the energy-saving renovation has completed 650 million kilowatts, accounting for more than 65% of all coal-fired power plants, including 350 million kilowatts during the 13th Five-Year Plan period. In advance, the target of 340 million kilowatts of “13th Five-Year Plan” was over-achieved.</font></font><br></p><p><img data-echo="http://img01.mybjx.net/news/UploadFile/201904/6368970478125411248850435.png" src="http://img01.mybjx.net/news/UploadFile/201904/6368970478125411248850435.png" title="27.png" alt="27.png"></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note: The data for 2016 is from the National Energy Administration, and the other is from the China Power Industry Annual Development Report.</font></font><br></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pollutant emissions in the power industry have declined significantly over the years, and the decline has increased slightly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2017, the total amount of soot emissions decreased by 25.7%, the total amount of sulfur dioxide emissions decreased by 29.4%, and the total amount of nitrogen oxides decreased by 26.5%, with a decrease of more than 20%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the end of 2017, coal-fired power plants have achieved desulfurization emissions in full, 92.3% of the units have achieved denitrification, and more than 75% of the coal-fired power units have achieved ultra-low emissions.

The total approved revenue was 48 billion yuan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On this basis, in 2018, the first regulatory cycle of the five major regional power grids in North China, Northeast China, East China, Central China and Northwest China (from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019) was approved. The transmission price of 24 cross-provincial special transmission projects has increased the permitted revenue of the grid enterprises by about 60 billion yuan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the other hand, the goal of “average industrial and commercial electricity price reduction of 10% on average” proposed in the 2018 government work report was overfulfilled in advance. Among them, the State Grid and China Southern Power Grid reduced the electricity cost of industrial and commercial enterprises by 79.2 billion yuan and 22.3 billion yuan respectively. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the analysis of China Electricity Council, power grid enterprises have fulfilled the universal service of electric power, and have continuously increased investment in construction of rural power grids, and some provincial power grid enterprises have suffered losses.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(2) The overall profitability of power generation enterprises has rebounded, but the thermal power operation situation is still grim.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the reorganization of the former China Power Investment Corporation and the National Nuclear Corporation into the National Power Investment Group, Guodian and Shenhua in 2017, the former five major power generation groups were renewed as the new five largest power generation groups.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The National Electric Power Investment Group, which has relatively deconstructed data, can see the glimpse of the leopard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, the state's total investment in electricity production was 108.13 billion yuan, with operating income of 226.656 billion yuan, profit of 10.818 billion yuan, and net profit of 6.59 billion yuan, an increase of 21.18%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Compared with last year, although the thermal power sector losses have dragged down the performance, the utilization hours of thermal power equipment and the consumption of new energy have improved, which has supported the corporate profits.</font></font></p><p><img data-echo="http://img01.mybjx.net/news/UploadFile/201904/6368970482498161359675857.png" src="http://img.mybjx.net/theme/default/wap/images/loading.gif" title="31.png" alt="31.png"></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note: According to relevant information in 2017, other data come from the National Social Investment 2016 Social Responsibility Report.</font></font><br></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Coal power enterprises have difficulties in operating. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to data released by China Electricity Council, China's coastal coal procurement price index (CECI Coastal Index) 5,500 kcal comprehensive price fluctuation range is 571 ~ 635 yuan / ton, domestic coal-fired power companies procurement costs remain high, 2018 year-round national thermal power The company's loss is still close to 50%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, the limited role of coal-fired electricity price linkage mechanism is also an important reason. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On January 29, Guodian Power issued a pre-reduction announcement. The net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies in 2018 is estimated to be 800 million to 1.4 billion yuan, down 32.19% to 61.25% year-on-year. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Guodian Power said that the main reason for the decline in performance was that coal prices rose, resulting in a year-on-year decline in operating profit.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is particularly noteworthy that the new five major power generation groups have achieved significant results in reducing leverage and reducing liabilities, and the asset-liability ratio will all be within 80% for the first time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Huaneng Group's asset-liability ratio has decreased to 78.74% in 2017, and decreased by 2 percentage points to 76.74% in 2018. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The debt ratio of Datang Group fell below 76.95%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Huadian Group's asset-liability ratio was 77.83%, down 2.97 percentage points year-on-year, and it fell for 10 consecutive years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The national debt group's asset-liability ratio was 78.61%, down 3.09 percentage points year-on-year. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The National Energy Group's asset-liability ratio was the lowest, at 60.09%, down 1.31 percentage points from the beginning of the year.</font></font></p><p><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">8. The market-oriented transaction power has increased substantially, and the power system reform has made new progress.</font></font></strong></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2015, a new round of power system reform was launched. After the accelerated expansion in 2016, the company made an in-depth effort in 2017. On the basis of the release of Document No. 9 and supporting documents, the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration issued a The series of policies and measures involve transmission and distribution prices, transmission-side reforms, incremental distribution network liberalization, and power trading rules. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, the electricity reform was carried out in Sham Shui Po. Various reforms were carried out in an orderly manner. New progress was made in the areas of transmission and distribution prices, incremental distribution reform, construction of the electricity spot market, and reform of the shareholding system of trading institutions, and further released the reform dividend. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, however, the problems encountered in the reform of the power system cannot be ignored.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first round of transmission and distribution cost supervision and examination has made a historic breakthrough. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since 2015, the first round of transmission and distribution pricing cost supervision and examination has been carried out. It is the first time in China's history to organize the supervision and examination of pricing costs for natural monopoly links, and achieved a major breakthrough from scratch. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, in 2015, the “Measures for Supervision and Examination of Transmission and Distribution Pricing Costs” was formulated, and the first cost supervision and examination method for large-scale network-type natural monopoly industries in China's history was established. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the data of the National Development and Reform Commission, the first round of transmission and distribution cost supervision and auditing has reduced unrelated and unreasonable expenses by about 128.4 billion yuan, with an average nuclear reduction ratio of 15.1%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Second, the degree of marketization of electricity has increased significantly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to statistics, through the first round of transmission and distribution cost supervision and verification and verification of independent transmission and distribution prices, China's electricity market-based transaction power reached 2.1 trillion kWh in 2018, and the proportion of sales of electricity has increased from 14% before 2015 to 2018. Nearly 40%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The third is to force monopoly enterprises to improve management and improve efficiency. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Through the supervision and examination of transmission and distribution costs, the company will send the “Reinforcement Cost Management Recommendation” to enterprises to guide enterprises to standardize management, internal tapping potential, reduce costs and increase efficiency.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Incremental distribution business reform and expansion. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2017, the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration announced the second batch of 89 incremental power distribution business reform pilot projects, and the number of pilot projects nationwide reached 195. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration identified the first batch of 125 pilot projects for incremental power distribution business reform. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, there are 320 pilot projects, which basically achieve full coverage of cities above the prefecture level. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A number of pilot projects have obtained power business licenses and realized grid-connected and distribution of electricity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The fourth batch of incremental power distribution business reform pilots are being declared, and areas with better conditions are trying to cover the county-level pilot projects.</font></font></p></div>
