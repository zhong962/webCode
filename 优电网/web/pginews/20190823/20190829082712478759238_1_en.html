It is vital to do all the work well. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the wave of reforms in the new era, how do power industry companies grasp market trends, optimize structure, integrate advantages, and explore new growth points in new models, which require diligence, dedication, and exploration.</font></font></p><p><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. The electricity consumption of the whole society is growing rapidly, and the power consumption structure is continuously optimized.</font></font></strong></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(1) The electricity consumption of the whole society increased by 8.5%, and the growth rate reached a new high of nearly seven years.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, the electricity consumption of the whole society in China has achieved rapid growth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the China Electricity Council Express, in 2018, the national total electricity consumption was 6.84 trillion kWh, an increase of 8.5% year-on-year and 1.9 percentage points year-on-year, the highest growth rate since 2012. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The per capita electricity consumption in the country is 4,956 kWh, and the per capita electricity consumption is 701 kWh.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of growth rate, the growth rate is more than 3 percentage points expected at the beginning of the year. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the forecast of CEC at the beginning of the year, power consumption in 2018 will continue to maintain a steady and rapid growth in 2017. It is estimated that the whole society's electricity consumption will increase by about 5.5%, and the actual growth rate is 8.5%, a record high of nearly seven years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, the continuous advancement of electric energy substitution policies, high-tech, equipment manufacturing, new demand for electricity in the Internet and related service industries, and rapid growth in urban and rural residents' electricity consumption have jointly promoted the growth of electricity consumption in the whole society in 2018.
