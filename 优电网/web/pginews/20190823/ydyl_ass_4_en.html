									<div align="center" style="padding-bottom: 30px;"><img src="http://news.eastday.com/images/thumbnailimg/month_1904/ddee8871ea5543309a226f4fba144e2f.jpg" style="max-width:680px"></div>
									<p class="pictext" style="text-align:center;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　The CMB staff of State Grid Pakistan Control Company, under the leadership of General Manager Cai Hongxian, worked together to ensure that the project was infallible.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As the first UHV transmission project for Chinese companies to independently invest, construct and operate overseas, the Meishan Phase II UHV transmission project with a total length of more than 2,500 kilometers has achieved China's UHV transmission technology, electrical equipment, engineering general contracting and operation. The integration of management has become an important practice for China to promote the construction of the “Belt and Road” in Brazil and Latin America. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And all this is inseparable from the hard work of a group of national netizens at the other end of the globe.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Up to now, the first phase of the Meishan Special High Voltage Project has been put into commercial operation on December 12, 2017. The progress of the second phase of the Meishan project, which was independently won by the State Grid Corporation of China, is also very smooth and will be completed ahead of schedule. This is absolutely unprecedented in Brazil. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the past, in Brazil, a project was not said to be delivered in advance, even if it was completed on time, it was an incredible thing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It can be said that the Meishan project once again demonstrated the magical power of "China's speed" in Brazil's land in Latin America.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Xiao Bin is the planning manager of the Meishan Phase II project company. He has been working in Brazil for 7 years. He witnessed the whole beautiful mountain project from scratch and was able to participate in such a project. Xiao Bin felt very glorious, but The long-term separation of the two families from their families and children will inevitably make Xiao Bin somewhat regrettable, especially the children who have just been born.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Xiao Bin said: "Now the children's WeChat video chat basically does not call me, maybe I know me, but my feelings are relatively weak, we can see a month a year, sometimes think about it."</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Life can last for a few seven years, but Fan Lingfeng, an engineer at the Meiji Project Company's planning office, has been in Brazil for 13 years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He laughed and said that he was almost half a Brazilian, but his concern for his family was not cut by half because of the increase in years.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fan Lingfeng said: "We always underestimate the speed of parents' aging. They went out to play ten years ago. They can easily follow my footsteps, but now it is no longer possible. The older the parents, the more I worry, I am now at night. There are always some weird dreams, and they are all directly related to the concerns of parents. This is probably what we often say about the day and night."</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The two old netizens who are almost incomprehensible are still the same, not to mention the young people who just graduated from college. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He Jiangying is the head of the comprehensive department of the second phase of the Meishan project. After graduating from the university, she was sent to Brazil to participate in the preparation of the second phase of the Meishan project. The relatively "life-adapted period" she experienced was other ages. What people can't imagine, she laughs and says that her "longest standby time" is three months, after which she must go home to charge.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He Jiangying said: "Of course I am very homesick. I was very strange at first, and there are no family members here. There will definitely be a time when one person can't hold back. Every time I come back from vacation, my state is the best, but only I can stick to it for three months. For me, three months is a hurdle, and I want to go home after three months."</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if he wants to go home every day, He Jiangying never regrets his life in the past few years.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He Jiangying said: "I never regret that the life in these years has been very exciting. I have witnessed the entire beautiful mountain project. From bidding and construction to the end of the present, although it is very hard, it is really worthwhile to look back. No matter in my career or in my life, it is a very big growth, painful and happy."</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The beautiful mountain is where Jiang Ying is growing, and Xiao Bin is more proud. He believes that the success of the beautiful mountain project has changed the view of Brazil on “Made in China”.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Xiao Bin said: "For a long time, we have been doing primary commodities. Now we have made several big power projects in the State Grid, especially the US II project. We imported a lot of high-end power equipment from China. Equipment Brazil is either incapable of producing, or they can do it, but China is doing better. The use of this high-end equipment in Brazil has largely changed the attitude and perception of Brazilians, especially those in the power sector, on our manufacturing in China. ""</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The beauty of the mountain to Fan Lingfeng is more gratifying. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fan Lingfeng, who is already a "half Brazilian", believes that the impact of Mount Mei in the future of Brazil is immeasurable.</font></font></p>
									<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fan Lingfeng said: "I am still very confident about our China's infrastructure. The second phase of the beautiful mountain is very significant for Brazil in terms of energy and infrastructure construction. It can be said to be invaluable."</font></font></p>
