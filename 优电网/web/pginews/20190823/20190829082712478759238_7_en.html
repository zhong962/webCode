							<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After a round of baptism, the electricity sales companies gradually showed polarization. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From 2017 to August 2018, the number of electricity sales companies registered with trading institutions nationwide increased from about 2,600 to about 3,600. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among them, the integrated sales of power sales companies grew rapidly. Most power generation companies (companies) registered more than one power sales company, and basically participated in direct transactions. At present, Guangdong's state-owned enterprise sales companies are still dominated by power generation companies. . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, the sales company has experienced the phenomenon of large-scale third-party sales companies withdrawing from the market. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, nearly half of the registered sales companies did not participate in direct transactions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, from the national electricity market barometer in Guangdong, the Guangdong Electric Power Trading Center issued the "Notice on the Settlement of Guangdong Power Market in December 2018", showing that in 2020, Guangdong had 416 access to electricity sales companies, but participated in the transaction. There are only 148 companies. Similar to 2017, the sales companies that actually participate in market-based transactions account for only one-third of the total, and a considerable number of power-selling companies are on the sidelines. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps one of the reasons for the wait-and-see is that the sales of power companies have seen a significant decline. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the "Notice on December 2018 and the Announcement of the Settlement of the Guangdong Power Market in the Whole Year", the total profit margin of the power plant in 2018 was 10.23 billion yuan, but the sales company only got 770 million yuan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Guangdong's electricity sales companies still have money to make, but compared to the net profit of 1.27 billion yuan in 2017, the sales of power companies in 2018 have decreased by nearly half. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the whole year, the sales of 30 power sales companies were negative, and the overall loss was 20.3%. The difference in revenue between various types of electricity sales companies was obvious. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Judging from the income of various types of electricity sales companies, the state-owned sales company's annual revenue was 96 million yuan, accounting for 17.1% of the total annual revenue; private sales companies' annual revenue was 564 million yuan, accounting for 80.9% of the total annual revenue. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is estimated that the state-owned electricity sales company's electricity revenue is 1.26%, the private electricity sales company's electricity revenue is 9.65%, the average electricity revenue is 3.64%, and the private sales company's yield is 7.64 times that of the state-owned enterprise.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Promote the standardization of power trading institutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2017, the nationwide provincial-level power trading center was basically completed except Tibet. Among them, Guangzhou Power Trading Center and Shanxi, Hubei, Chongqing, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hainan and other eight provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) power trading center For joint-stock companies, other power trading centers are still wholly-owned subsidiaries of power grid companies, and have not yet achieved relatively independent and standardized operation of power trading institutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration issued the "Notice on Promoting the Standardization Construction of Electric Power Trading Organizations", requiring the shareholding system transformation of the Beijing Electric Power Trading Center, the Guangzhou Electric Power Trading Center, and the power trading centers of the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities). The capital stock ratio of power grid enterprises should be no less than 20%, and it is encouraged to improve the shareholding structure according to the non-grid enterprise capital accounting for about 50% of the shares. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, 25 power trading institutions within the scope of the State Grid have started the shareholding system transformation.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The spot transaction pilot was launched. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Eight regions (starting in Guangdong), Mengxi, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Shandong, Fujian, Sichuan, and Gansu were selected as the first pilot projects for the construction of electric power spot market. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On August 31, 2018, the southern spot (starting in Guangdong) started the power spot market and became the first power spot market in China to be put into trial operation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Subsequently, Gansu and Shanxi power spot markets started trial operation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the requirements of the National Energy Administration, the other five pilot areas will also start the simulation test run before the end of June this year. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time as the breakthrough in the pilot construction, the printing of the "Power Market Operation System Spot Trading and Spot Settlement Function Guide (Trial)" confirmed the basic functions and business requirements of the spot trading and spot settlement of the electricity market operation system, and further improved the spot market operation rules. .</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The scale of market-based trading power has gradually expanded. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2016, the national market-oriented trading power exceeded 1 trillion kWh, accounting for about 19% of the total electricity consumption of the whole society. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2017, the national marketized electricity consumption totaled 1.63 trillion kWh, a year-on-year increase of 45%, accounting for about 26% of the total electricity consumption of the whole society. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the basis of reducing the cost of electricity for the real economy by 100 billion yuan last year, it will reduce the real economy by 70 billion yuan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the relevant data of the National Development and Reform Commission, in 2018, China's electricity market trading power is about 2.1 trillion kWh, accounting for nearly 40% of the electricity sales.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The effect of reducing the cost of electricity is obvious. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The 2018 government work report stated that “the average industrial and commercial electricity price is reduced by 10% on average”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this regard, the power industry has been conscientiously implemented, exceeding the target of 10% reduction. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By adjusting the value-added tax rate of the power industry (from 17% to 16%), some monopoly service charges for power grid enterprises will be abolished, and the unreasonable price increase behavior of the power supply link will be comprehensively cleaned up, and the national major water conservancy project construction fund collection standard will be reduced by 25%. A number of simultaneous efforts have been made to reduce the electricity expenditure of general industrial and commercial enterprises by 113.8 billion yuan.</font></font></p><p><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">9. The major power companies seek a profound transformation, and the goal of creating a "world-class enterprise" is clearer.</font></font></strong></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China has decided to build a well-off society in an all-round way and build a grand blueprint for building a socialist modernization power. It has made decision-making arrangements for politics, economy, society, culture, and ecological civilization: by 2035, basic socialist modernization will be achieved. By the middle of this century, a strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious and beautiful socialist modernization power will be built. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises, developing a mixed-ownership economy, and cultivating world-class enterprises with global competitiveness" set the tone for enterprise development and became an important follow-up of China's major power companies.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, power central enterprises have optimized their strategic plans and proposed timetables and roadmaps for building world-class enterprises. The time nodes of the plan echoed the new two-stage report of the Party’s 19th National Congress. The goal of struggle. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, the State Grid deepens the strategic goal of “building a world-class energy Internet enterprise” and proposes a world-class energy Internet enterprise that builds a hub-type, platform-type, shared-type, strong smart grid, and ubiquitous power Internet of Things. Strategic goals, and strive to build a world-class energy Internet company with global competitiveness by the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Party in 2021. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the basis of the basic positioning of “national team status, platform-based enterprises and value chain integrators”, South Network put forward the practice of positioning new development concepts, national strategy implementers, energy revolution promoters, power market builders, and state-owned enterprise reform pioneers. Smart grid operators, energy industry value chain integrators, energy ecosystem service providers, the new strategy of “five” and “three businesses” will have the distinctive features of world-class enterprises with global competitiveness by 2020.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Huaneng Group is positioned as the core, coal-based, financial support, technology-led, and industrial synergy. It strives to ensure that it will enter the ranks of world-class enterprises with strong global competitiveness in the SASAC within five years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Datang Group is positioned to engage in power, heat production and supply, power-related coal resource development and production, and related professional technical services, focusing on quality, efficiency, and power “three changes” deployment and implementation of “1+1+N” The architecture reform plan and the 158 development strategy will “build a world-class energy group in an all-round way” and gradually catch up with it by 2020, and take the lead in 2035. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Huadian Group transformed from a single power generation group to a comprehensive energy group that co-developed four major industries of power generation, coal, finance and science and technology, and focused on the vision of “building a world-class energy company with global competitiveness”. The company's medium and long-term development ideas: accurately grasp the "five adherences", continue to promote the "three transformations", and strive to achieve "six first-class." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The National Energy Group has eight industrial sectors including coal, thermal power, new energy, hydropower, transportation, chemicals, science and technology, environmental protection, and finance. It has established the overall strategic goal of “building a world-class energy group with global competitiveness” and a fundamental politics. Principles, six core concepts, and nine corporate development strategies for managing enterprises. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Based on the strategic positioning of advanced energy technology developers, clean low-carbon energy suppliers and energy ecosystem integrators, the National Power Investment Group will create a world-class clean energy enterprise with global competitiveness; the phased strategic goal of building a first-class enterprise is: In 2020, it will become a leading clean energy enterprise in China; by 2025, it will become a clean energy enterprise with certain international influence; by 2035, renewable energy such as nuclear power and photovoltaic will develop into a globally competitive leader and famous brand. Building a world-class clean energy company with global competitiveness.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The new five major power generation groups have decided to transform from power companies to integrated energy companies, and expand to the coal, finance, and science and technology fields based on the power business. Among them, the national power investment group highlights its clean energy competitiveness and positioning, and must create global competitiveness. The world's leading clean energy enterprises; power grid enterprises have proposed development characteristics such as "platform" and "smart grid", pointing to integrated energy service providers.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The "Notice on the Relevant Matters Concerning the Establishment of a World-Class Model Enterprise by Central Enterprises", which was recently solicited opinions, shows that the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission will further decentralize and authorize the demonstration enterprises to make independent decision-making, comprehensive use of mixed reform, employee stock ownership, equity incentives and other state-owned enterprise reform policies. The world-class enterprises that strive to build "three leading", "three leading" and "three models" have achieved remarkable results in about three years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ten units including PetroChina, State Grid, Three Gorges, National Energy Group and China Guangdong Nuclear Power were selected as world-class demonstration enterprises. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among them, the State Grid has proposed a number of state-owned enterprise reform plans. Based on the exploration of the fields of incremental power distribution, trading institutions and pumped storage power stations, the pilot program will be expanded to UHV DC projects, integrated energy services, and electric vehicles. In the fields of information communication, navigation and other services, the equipment manufacturing enterprises will be promoted as a whole, and the financial sector will be expanded from Yingda Trust to all businesses. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is reported that the National Energy Group has reported to the first-class model enterprise program this year, and mixed reform and employee holdings are part of it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the emergence of new energy formats and new models, the profound transformation of power companies is not only a requirement for adapting to the new era and a new situation, but also a conscious pursuit of taking the initiative.</font></font></p><p><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ten, multiple reforms and advancement, industry development requires early planning and precise policy</font></font></strong></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, the global new round of energy transformation, which is characterized by clean and low carbon, is accelerating. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As the center of the energy system, the development of the power industry is affected by the superposition of multiple factors. How to adapt to the situation and take the initiative, we need to coordinate and plan scientific response.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The power supply side reform will continue to deepen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Central Economic Work Conference called for the economic work in 2019 to continue to deepen supply-side reforms in accordance with the eight-character policy of “consolidating, enhancing, upgrading, and smoothing”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This year's government work report pointed out that we must continue to adhere to the supply-side structural reform as the main line, adopt more reform methods, and use more market-oriented and rule-of-law methods to consolidate the results of the "three to one, one reduction and one supplement". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is also the general requirement for the reform of the energy and power supply side in 2019.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Release advanced production capacity and improve the level of coordinated power development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Faced with the new situation and new problems arising from the timely release of coal production capacity and advanced production capacity, the elimination of excess capacity of coal-fired power generation and the ensuring of safe and stable supply of electricity, it is necessary to handle the relationship between increments and stocks and accelerate the development of advanced production capacity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Facing the situation that the overall supply and demand balance of power and the regional time supply are coexisting, we will vigorously develop distributed clean energy, improve relevant policy guarantees, market mechanisms and standard systems, promote the expansion of pilot demonstrations, and strive to achieve regional power supply and demand balance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the face of the problem of insufficient imbalance in the development of the power industry, we will vigorously develop clean energy while improving and upgrading the coal-fired power industry.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Continue to promote the green and low carbon transformation of electricity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although China's coal-fired ultra-low emission reform has already achieved a huge breakthrough, it still needs to be further advanced. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will continue to improve the energy efficiency level of coal-fired power plants, speed up the resolution of wind, light and water power consumption problems, speed up the construction of peaking power supplies such as pumped storage power stations and leading hydropower stations, strengthen the flexibility of thermal power generation, deepen peak regulation of units, and upgrade existing transmission channels. Utilization rate.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reform of the power system is going deeper. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2019, the National Energy Work Conference will focus on “in-depth promotion of power system reform” as a key task. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will accelerate the construction of a competitive power market system, promote the independent and standardized operation of power trading institutions, continuously improve the power market trading mechanism, comprehensively push forward the construction of power auxiliary service market, research and promote the construction of power spot market, and accelerate the reform of incremental power distribution business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2019, the policy was further exerted. The state issued a document to further promote the reform of the incremental power distribution business and regulate the management of priority power generation priority power purchase plans. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deepening the reform of the power system is an opportunity and a challenge for enterprises.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Continue to help optimize the business environment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Optimizing the business environment” is a key task clearly defined in this year's government work report. The improvement of the business environment is inextricably linked to the convenience, economy and reliability of obtaining electricity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2019, the industry enterprises implemented the goal of “reducing the average electricity price of general industrial and commercial buildings by another 10%”, further reducing the cost of equipment installation and electricity consumption, shortening the time for power outages, and further efforts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, we must pay attention to the clean-up of unreasonable price increases in the power supply link, so that power users can enjoy the benefits.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accelerate the development of new models and new business dynamism. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Driven by technology, new modes of energy and power, new business forms emerge one after another, and new growth momentum continues to accumulate. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The development of the industry is in the transition period between new and old kinetic energy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is necessary to promote the energy technology revolution, accelerate the breakthrough of key core technologies in the fields of smart grid, advanced nuclear power, gas turbine, hydrogen energy and fuel cell, and cultivate the advantages of power technology and accelerate the transformation into economic advantages. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deepen the R&amp;D and application of big data and artificial intelligence, and build a “smart power plant” to promote the development of a strong smart grid and a ubiquitous power Internet of Things, and optimize the re-engineering power distribution and distribution industry chain.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To promote the high-quality development of power in the new era, on the one hand, the decision-making departments should pay attention to the policy balance and innovation system and mechanism, and create conditions for the power enterprises to do superior stocks and increase the scale; on the other hand, they need to take the initiative to actively adapt to the new situation and new challenges. Take effective and targeted measures, effectively take the initiative in your hands, and truly promote the industry to achieve "quality change, efficiency change, power change."</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(Total Note: The data cited in this article are all from authoritative and credible data.
