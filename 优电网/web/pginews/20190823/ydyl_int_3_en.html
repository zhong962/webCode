										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The global energy Internet construction is breaking fast. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recently, a centralized signing ceremony with the theme of global energy Internet and “One Belt, One Road” construction was held in Beijing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Global Energy Internet Development Cooperation Organization (hereinafter referred to as the “Cooperative Organization”) initiated by China and UN-HABITAT, UNESCO, UN ESCWA, World Meteorological Organization, Moscow Power Institute, Ethiopian Ministry of Energy and Haihe The Grid Administration signed six cooperation agreements to jointly promote the development of the “Belt and Road”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, the cooperative organization officially released the first “One Belt, One Road” energy Internet construction plan.</font></font></p>
										<div align="center" style="padding-bottom: 30px;"><img src="http://crawl.ws.126.net/8c68d24853eadd7e7cfa2d5f7d525952.jpg" style="max-width:680px"></div>
										<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Create a new engine for the “Belt and Road” construction</font></font></h3>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Global Energy Internet is known as the “highway” for clean energy transportation around the world. It is the basic platform for large-scale development, transportation and use of clean energy on a global scale. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Huang Qili, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said that accelerating the construction of a global energy Internet coincides with the common interests of all countries in the world. The implementation method is to build a global smart grid network with UHV transmission as the backbone network and coordinated development of all levels of power grids.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The “Belt and Road” countries are rich in clean energy resources. According to the data, water, solar and wind energy reserves in Asia and Africa account for 58%, 65% and 58% of the world respectively. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to make good use of this "wealth" to turn resource advantages into economic advantages? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cooperative organization research proposed the first “One Belt, One Road” energy Internet construction plan to create a green, low-carbon, interconnected, and mutually beneficial energy community.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Building a global energy Internet will fundamentally address major challenges such as lack of resources, environmental pollution, climate change, and health and poverty, and create a new engine and build a new platform for accelerating the construction of the 'One Belt, One Road'," said Liu Zhenya, chairman of the cooperative organization.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the first “One Belt, One Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum in 2017, the cooperation organization signed five cooperation agreements with the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the African Union, the Arab League, and the GCC Power Grid Administration. The results of the contract were included. List of results of the summit forum.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Two years have passed and all the contents of the cooperation agreement have been implemented. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among them, the Global Energy Internet is included in the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda working framework and is included in the Beijing Declaration of the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab Cooperation Forum. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cooperative organization and the GCC Power Grid Authority and the Ethiopian Ministry of Energy have formed a joint working group to promote the construction of the power interconnection project in the Ethiopia-Gulf area. It is planned to complete the project pre-feasibility study this year.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Up to now, the cooperative organization has established partnerships with governments, organizations, enterprises, institutions and universities in more than 80 countries, and signed more than 30 cooperation agreements covering the global energy Internet concept dissemination, basic research, project construction and other aspects. . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The number of cooperative organizations reached 635, covering 93 countries (regions) on 5 continents, including 26 Fortune 500 companies.</font></font></p>
										<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conditional priority to achieve breakthrough progress</font></font></h3>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On March 10th, China State Grid Co., Ltd. was the first UHV project to independently invest, construct and operate in foreign countries – Brazil's beautiful mountain hydropower ±800 kV UHV DC sent out the second phase of the project. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This line of more than 2,500 kilometers will send the abundant rainwater from the Amazon rainforest to Rio de Janeiro, not only solving the long-distance energy transmission problem that has long plagued Brazil, but also creating 16,000 jobs and R$29 billion in taxes. It is expected to be put into operation in the third quarter of this year.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To promote the construction of the “Belt and Road”, we must seize the key landmark projects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The construction of energy infrastructure with grid interconnection as the core is becoming an effective carrier for the “Belt and Road” facilities, and has the conditions to make breakthroughs.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During the second “One Belt, One Road” International Cooperation Summit, the Global Energy Internet Development Cooperation Organization released two research results of the “One Belt and One Road” National Energy Internet Research Report and the “Global Energy Internet Implementation “One Belt and One Road Development Report”. The plan and action plan for comprehensively promoting the "five links" and accelerating the interconnection of the "One Belt, One Road" national grid will be put forward, and efforts will be made to describe the "Belt and Road" construction of "Meticulous Paintings".</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is understood that the cooperative organization focuses on the six economic corridors and the three major blue economic channels, focusing on the development of the "6+3" channel, development ideas and interconnection and interoperability programs. The plan proposes to the "2050" area. All the way, the national energy Internet 67 projects, the total transport route of 126,000 kilometers of key projects.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Taking the China-Pakistan channel as an example, the study proposes to build a ±660 kV and ±800 kV DC project from Xinjiang, China to Pakistan, to realize the interconnection between China's western region and Pakistan, and to promote Pakistan as a hub for communication between China, Central Asia and the Middle East.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A "power line" is being laid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, China has achieved grid interconnection with neighboring countries such as Russia, Mongolia, Laos and Vietnam, and is actively promoting grid interconnection projects such as China-Korea, China-Myanmar-Meng.</font></font></p>
										<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The total investment will reach 27 trillion US dollars</font></font></h3>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nearly 300 kilometers from Kinshasa to Matadi in the lower Congo River, it is praised by industry experts as the world's most abundant hydropower resource. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With 32 waterfalls and rapids, the total drop of 280 meters is very suitable for the construction of super-large hydropower stations with a total installed capacity of more than 110 million kilowatts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among them, the installed capacity of the Greater Canada project can reach 60 million kilowatts, and the power generation is equivalent to eight Three Gorges power stations.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cooperation organization innovation put forward the "electric-mine-smelting-work-trade" linkage development model, planning to use ultra-long-distance, ultra-large-capacity UHV transmission technology to send the Congo River to the West Africa, supporting the aluminum and other countries in Guinea and other countries. The steel industry is upgraded to meet the energy needs of industrial development.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Guinea's Minister of State and President of the President's Office, Kabbah, said that Guinea's economic development is constrained by the shortage of energy resources. Only relying on domestic resources can not fully meet the development of electrolytic aluminum and other industries. It is necessary to strengthen interconnection with neighboring national power grids to make up for the power gap.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, the cooperative organization is cooperating with the Greater Canada Development Promotion Agency, the responsible agency of the Congolese government's Greater Canada project, to provide project planning consulting services. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Director of the Inga Development and Development Agency, Carrara, said that the promotion of the Greater Inga project and the interconnection of multinational power grids will meet the demand for large-scale extractive industries and cross-regional industrial electricity. Chinese companies are welcome to participate.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the research of cooperative organizations, in 2050, the total investment of the “One Belt, One Road” national energy Internet will reach 27 trillion US dollars, 200 million new jobs will be created, and the “One Belt, One Road” national clean energy power generation capacity will account for more than 80% of the total installed capacity. In Asia and Africa, the annual electricity consumption per capita reaches 7,000 kWh and 1,500 kWh, respectively, enabling people to enjoy sustainable energy and modern electricity services.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Co-construction, co-construction and sharing, the global governance concept of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative is being used in the process of global energy Internet construction, and the tremendous economic development opportunities brought about by global interconnection have won recognition and support from the international community.</font></font></p>
										<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Suwadi, president of the Abu Dhabi Investment Committee of the United Arab Emirates, said that China’s successful practice in UHV technology has made cross-country and intercontinental power interconnection possible. Future power transmission will not only be limited to the country, but also expects multinational power including the Gulf region. The transportation project can achieve greater progress and breakthroughs.</font></font></p>
