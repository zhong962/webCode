									<p>For a long time, the lack of power supply has always been the main factor leading to the tight supply and demand of electricity in China. In recent years, with the increase in power demand, the new energy installed capacity has developed rapidly, and the power supply has basically got rid of the situation of short supply. Recalling the growth characteristics of power generation installed capacity in China during the 40 years of reform and opening up is of great significance for accurately grasping the changing trend of China's power supply. </p>
									<div align="center" style="padding-bottom: 30px;"><img src="http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20180814/0c8ed5702c474c66be0e11c29168b805.png" style="max-width:680px" ></div>
									<p>From the total installed capacity to the world's first, the per capita installed capacity has exceeded 1 kilowatt. Since the reform and opening up, China's total installed capacity has grown rapidly. By the end of 2017, the national installed capacity of power generation reached 1.78 billion kilowatts, including 1.11 billion kilowatts of thermal power, 340 million kilowatts of hydropower, 160 million kilowatts of wind power, 130 million kilowatts of solar power, and 36 million yuan of nuclear power. kilowatt. In the past 40 years, the total installed capacity has increased by 31.1 times, with an average annual growth rate of 9.2%, which is 0.6 percentage points higher than the average annual growth rate of electricity consumption in the whole society (8.6%), which promotes the overall easing of power supply from China to supply and demand. The transformation. As of the end of 2017, China's total installed capacity, hydropower, thermal power, wind power and solar power installed capacity are the world's first, the per capita installed capacity reached 1.3 kW; sub-type installed capacity, thermal power installed capacity increased steadily, non-fossil energy installed capacity increased rapidly . From 2012 to 2017, the average annual growth rate of thermal power installed capacity dropped to 6.2%, and the annual growth rate of hydropower, nuclear power, wind power and solar installed capacity reached 6.5%, 23.3%, 21.7% and 107.2% respectively.</p>
                                    <div align="center" style="padding-bottom: 30px;"><img src="http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20180814/e85b59dd607740d0b9cb95bc43796f4c.png" style="max-width:680px" ></div>
									<p>The power supply structure continues to be optimized, and the proportion of non-fossil energy installed capacity has increased significantly. With the installation of nuclear power, wind power and solar power, China's power supply structure has evolved from water and fire to water, fire, nuclear, wind, solar and other power sources. Since 2012, non-fossil energy, represented by wind power, solar power and nuclear power, has developed rapidly, with an average annual growth rate of installed capacity of 15.5%. As of the end of 2017, the installed capacity of non-fossil energy reached 670 million kilowatts, accounting for 37.8% of the total installed capacity, an increase of 9.2 percentage points over 2012. The installed capacity of wind power, solar energy and nuclear power accounted for 9.2%, 7.3%, and 2.0%, respectively, up 3.9, 7.0, and 0.9 percentage points from 2012.</p>
									<div align="center" style="padding-bottom: 30px;"><img src="http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20180814/306c1532e11e405da88ad877d8702934.png" style="max-width:680px" ></div>
									<p>The newly added installed capacity has grown by leaps and bounds, and the power generation side cleaning alternative has achieved outstanding results. In terms of the total amount, the development of new installed capacity can be roughly divided into three stages: before 1987, the annual installed capacity was about 5 million kilowatts; from 1988 to 2005, the annual installed capacity was about 20 million kilowatts; China's economy and electricity demand are growing rapidly, and the newly installed power generation capacity has reached a record high. In 2006, it exceeded 100 million kilowatts. In the next 11 years, due to the rapid growth of new energy power generation capacity, the newly installed power generation capacity will continue to be 100 million kilowatts. Around 2017, it reached 130 million kilowatts in 2017, a record high, and the newly installed capacity is close to the total volume of South Korea. From the perspective of the newly installed capacity structure, new energy gradually replaced thermal power as the main force. Before 2012, the newly added power generation capacity was mainly thermal power units. With the rapid development of new energy sources, in 2016, the newly installed new energy capacity exceeded the thermal power for the first time. In 2017, of the newly installed capacity, the installed capacity of thermal power only accounted for 35.6%, a record low; the total installed capacity of wind power and solar power reached 55.4%, an increase of 37.6 percentage points over 2012.									</p>
                                    <div align="center" style="padding-bottom: 30px;"><img src="http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20180814/8f858ccd73de44cf916055d997b8abe9.png" style="max-width:680px" ></div>
									<p>The power generation continues to grow rapidly, and the proportion of green power generation continues to increase. From 1978 to 2017, China's power generation increased from 256.6 billion kWh to 641.79 billion kWh, an increase of 25.0 times, and the average annual growth rate reached 8.6%. In 2011, it replaced the United States as the world's largest power generation. From the perspective of power generation growth, the traditional energy generation with thermal power and hydropower is growing steadily, and the new energy generation is growing rapidly. Since 2012, the annual growth rate of hydropower and thermal power generation is only 6.9% and 3.0%, and the average annual growth rate of wind power, nuclear power and solar power generation has reached 20.4%, 24.3% and 101.1% respectively. From the perspective of power generation structure, thermal power is still the basic power source for power generation, but the proportion of power generation has dropped rapidly. Since 2012, the contribution rate of non-fossil energy to power generation growth has reached 56.3%, surpassing thermal power to become the main engine of power generation growth.</p>
                                    <p>he regional layout is further optimized. In 2017, the installed capacity in North China, East China, Central China, Northeast China, Northwest China, Southwest China and South China accounted for 21.9%, 19.6%, 12.7%, 7.8%, 13.8%, 6.9% and 17.3%, respectively. Affected by regional resource endowment differences and load distribution, hydropower is mainly distributed in the south, southwest and north China, accounting for 33.7%, 25.2% and 18.3% respectively. Thermal power is mainly distributed in North China and East China, accounting for 27.1 respectively. % and 23.5%; nuclear power is distributed in East China, South China and Northeast China, accounting for 48.6%, 38.9% and 12.5% ​​respectively; wind power is mainly distributed in North China, Northwest China and Northeast China (“Three North” regions), accounting for 29.7%, 27.8% and 16.8%; solar power generation is mainly distributed in the northwest, north China and eastern China, accounting for 28.1%, 24.5% and 21.2% respectively.</p>		
                                	<p>The average utilization hours of thermal power equipment showed a general downward trend. Since the reform and opening up, the average utilization hours of thermal power generation equipment in China has been maintained at more than 5,000 hours per year. After 2004, the utilization hours of thermal power generation showed a downward trend. The first reason is that the growth rate of thermal power installed capacity (11.3%) is faster than that of power consumption. The speed (8.5%), the second is the rapid growth of non-fossil energy power generation squeezed the thermal power space. In 2017, the average utilization hours of power generation equipment for power plants of 6000 kW and above nationwide was 3,786 hours, which was the lowest since 1964, which was 1669 hours lower than that of 2004. Among them, thermal power was 4,209 hours, the second lowest since 1964 (4,186 hours in 2016), which was 1,782 hours lower than that in 2004.</p>

									<p>Conclusion: Since the reform and opening up, China's power construction has been accelerating, and many indicators have leapt to the top in the world, with power powers moving rapidly toward power powerhouses. The growth of power generation capacity has undergone a historical transformation of “expanding capacity”, “adjusting structure” and “excellent layout”, reversing the long-term power supply shortage and building an increasingly clean power supply structure. China has gradually become the leader of global clean energy development. By.</p>
