									<p>At present, the world is making progress towards a “cleaner future”, and China's photovoltaic power generation industry is about to enter a stage of rapid growth. At the beginning of this year, the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration issued the "Notice on Actively Promoting Non-subsidized Internet Access for Wind Power and Photovoltaic Power Generation", gradually eliminating subsidies for wind power and photovoltaic power generation, and actively promoting affordable Internet access. Recently, this notice was supplemented, and the “Work Plan for the Promotion of Wind Power and Photovoltaic Power Generation Unsubsidized Budget Internet Projects (Draft for Comment)” (hereinafter referred to as the “Program”) was issued to accelerate the implementation of the policy. The time limit for the introduction of the subsidy policy is also given.</p>
									<p>The proposal proposes:</p>
                                    <p>First, fully reduce the non-technical costs of affordable Internet projects, enjoy various priorities, and ensure consumption.</p>
                                    <p>Second, the recorded projects can abandon subsidies and enjoy the protection of consumption.</p>
                                    <p>Third, the subsidy policy may be introduced from late April to early May.</p>
                                    <div align="center" style="padding-bottom: 30px;"><img src="https://www.solarbe.com/file/upload/201904/16/18280527205540.png" style="max-width:680px"></div>
                                    <p>It can be seen that wind power and photovoltaic parity are inevitable trends. Although the subsidy scale and subsidy intensity are continuously decreasing, with the decline of photovoltaic power generation costs and the promotion of parity projects, the installed capacity is expected to be considerable this year. In the future, the competition between wind power and photovoltaic power generation is mainly due to the competition of electricity costs. The cost of photovoltaic power generation has entered a stage of being cheaper than wind power. Especially after the full realization of parity, PV has a greater potential for cost reduction.</p>
                                    <p>From the current production side of the photovoltaic industry, it is now in the stage of integration. Many leading companies cover the silicon wafer, battery, components and other links, many of which are internal procurement, which can achieve better profitability by reducing costs. This has formed the current pattern, namely the specialization of polysilicon and the integration trend of post-polysilicon links.</p>
                                    <p>On the other hand, the trend of specialization has now risen, such as the battery segment. Relative to the component link, the technical aspect of the battery segment is much higher. If some enterprises have a higher trend of specialization, the general profit level is not high last year, but the growth rate of these specialized companies is above 100%. Therefore, the direction of future industrial development still has to take the path of specialization, and integration has only a staged advantage. In essence, the photovoltaic industry is market-driven, but on the other hand, this industry is policy-oriented, so it is a policy-driven market and a market-driven industry.</p>
                                    <div align="center" style="padding-bottom: 30px;"><img src="https://www.solarbe.com/file/upload/201904/16/18281611205540.png" style="max-width:680px"></div>
                                    <p>At present, domestic PV companies are expanding their scale and occupying the market. Research base and original technology are more important. As a leader in the industry, Zhanyu Photovoltaic is committed to technology research and development, component efficiency improvement and product cost reduction in the field of photovoltaics. It has gathered crystalline silicon battery manufacturers, component integrators and upstream and downstream resources, and won the “China Industrial and Commercial Distributed Photovoltaic Quality Service Award”. ", the "Top Ten Operations Stars" and other awards, the strength is obvious to all. In the future, in the continuous development of the photovoltaic industry, Zhanyu will continue to focus on R&D and seize opportunities, and help the day of affordable Internet access as soon as possible.</p>
