						<p>　　<font face="楷体_GB2312"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The editors follow the journey of advancement, always experiencing exploration and practice, hardships and fighting; the path of scientific development must be bound to the strength of progress and brilliant achievements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">State Grid Corporation adheres to the scientific development concept as a guide, vigorously promotes the transformation of the company and the development mode of the power grid, actively serves the economic and social development, and has made brilliant achievements.</font></font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　On May 31, at the summit of the leaders of the Global Sustainable Power Cooperation Organization held in Berlin, Germany, Liu Zhenya, general manager and party secretary of China State Grid Corporation, relied on UHV technology that has made breakthroughs in China, and proposed to build a Eurasian transcontinental UHV. The strategic concept of the energy channel has been resounding for a while.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　This is a strong signal: China's power grid, not only has reached the world's largest scale, but also leads the world in terms of “quality” and has embarked on the road of power grid development with Chinese characteristics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The development of the State Grid has pushed China's power powers to power powerhouses.</font></font></p>
						<p>　　<strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Guided by the scientific development concept, the development of the power grid is clear</font></font></strong></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　Looking back on the road to development, strategic success is the key. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Hu Jintao as General Secretary has put forward the important strategic thinking of the scientific concept of development, and creatively answered major theoretical and practical issues such as "what kind of development and how to develop". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Guided by this, the State Grid Corporation, as an enterprise that plays an important role in China's energy optimization configuration, is actively entering the scientific development track.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　On November 12, 2004, the main responsible person meeting of each unit of the State Grid Corporation was held. “One Strong and Three Excellent” became the guide for the unified thinking and action of the State Grid Corporation, inspiring the State Grid to “build a world-class power grid and build a world-class city. The corporate vision of the company is unremitting.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　On May 21, 2009, State Grid Corporation proposed a strong smart grid development strategy at the UHV International Conference, and strived to build a modern grid with strong grid and intelligent organic integration. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cui John, deputy general manager of the Electric Power Division of LS Corporation of South Korea, said that there is an old saying in China that "fish and bear's paw can't have both", but in his view, the integration of "strong" and "smart" in China is appropriate, indicating "fish And the bear's paw is available."</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　On April 10, 2012, Liu Zhenya’s book "China's Power and Energy" was first published. The book, based on the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, first proposed the concept of "big energy concept" and explained the power in the energy strategy. The central position is remarkable.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　The development of the power grid is always clear. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reason is that after the company explored the practice, it established the strategic goal of “one strong and three excellent” modern company and the “two first-class” corporate vision, clarified the strategic path of “two transformations” and formed a strategy to lead the company's scientific development. system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This system has an accurate positioning of the scientific development rules of China's power industry and the functions and functions of China's power grid.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　What is the grid? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">State Grid people think deeply about this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Especially in the face of the ever-increasing situation of coal, electricity and oil transportation in recent years, facing the financial crisis that has spread to China after 2008, the State Grid Corporation has given new meaning to the “grid” in the face of the new energy revolution.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　Consensus has been formed: a strong smart grid is not only a power transmission carrier that connects power and customers, but also an energy resource optimization configuration carrier with network market functions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is the sacred mission of the State Grid Corporation to give full play to the functions of the power grid, to ensure a safer, more economical, cleaner and sustainable power supply, to promote healthier development, a more harmonious society and a better life.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　What is the most important and urgent task to solve China's energy and power supply problems? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">State Grid Corporation believes that starting from the basic national conditions, it is crucial to implement the "one special four major" strategy, accelerate the development of UHV power grids, scale, intensively, and efficiently develop large coal-fired power, large hydropower, large nuclear power and large-scale renewable energy power generation bases.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　Lin Boqiang, a professor at Xiamen University, said in an interview with the reporter of "Half-Monthly Talk" recently that the "One Special Four" strategy has demonstrated a new perspective on China's energy development. Its important significance lies in the development of the power industry itself, from the traditional passive protection of electricity. Supply, and actively participate in the optimal allocation of China's energy resources and environmental resources. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When talking about "one special four big", Wang Binghua, chairman of the National Nuclear Power Technology Corporation, said that the idea and strategy of this big energy is in line with the reality of China's economic and social sustainable development and is in line with the future of China's energy industry.</font></font></p>
						<p>　　<strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Building a strong smart grid to optimize the allocation of energy resources</font></font></strong></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　Throughout the development, the construction of a strong smart grid has enabled the national grid's resource optimization and allocation capabilities, economic operation efficiency, safety level and intelligence level to be comprehensively improved.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　On January 6, 2009, the 1000 kV Jindongnan-Nanyang-Jingmen UHV AC test demonstration project was officially put into operation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This laid a solid foundation for the comprehensive advancement of the UHV project and the construction of a strong smart grid with the UHV grid as the backbone network.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　As of the end of 2011, the State Grid's wind power grid-connected installed capacity of 45.05 million kilowatts, photovoltaic power grid-connected installed capacity of 2.14 million kilowatts, the acceptance of large coal-fired, hydropower and nuclear power base installed capacity of 158 million kilowatts, 44.03 million kilowatts and 6.45 million kilowatts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, the national grid's trans-regional transmission capacity exceeds 40 million kilowatts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is estimated that by 2020, the UHV backbone grid will deliver 1.6 trillion kWh of electricity per year, equivalent to 800 million tons of raw coal.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　The seemingly boring data is actually the crystallization of scientific strategy and firm execution, which is directly related to China's present and future.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　In Shanghai, Jiang Yiren, member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and chairman of the China Power Engineering Society, said that Shanghai's economy is developed, developing rapidly and local energy is relatively scarce. The development of UHV grids and smart grids provides a new perspective for Shanghai's economic transformation during the 12th Five-Year Plan period. .</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　In Xinjiang, the Uighur girl, the hot Khan Guli, was deeply touched by the conversion of Hami coal into electricity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Her father is a coal truck driver who has been on the road for many years. He said that the cost of transporting coal is higher than the cost of coal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"When it is shipped to a distant place, the profit of one ton of coal can't be replaced by a plate of noodles. Now it is much more convenient to get the electricity out of the coal, and it can also sell a good price."</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　In Lhasa, Tibet, the past power shortages have disappeared this year. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Qinghai-Tibet network project, which was put into operation at the end of 2011, has accumulated more than 400 million kWh of electricity to Tibet in half a year, which effectively guaranteed the power supply of the Tibet-China power grid and fully utilized the resources sharing and complementary advantages in the national grid.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　The highlights of the development of the State Grid Corporation are encouraging. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The goal of moving forward is exciting.</font></font></p>
						<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　　"Building the national grid into a modern large-scale power grid with strong grid, strong and reliable, green and low-carbon, cost-effective, powerful resource allocation capability, service guarantee capability and ability to withstand risks." The call made at the 2012 work conference is inspiring the State Grid to make unremitting efforts to achieve the goal of basically building a strong smart grid in 2020.</font></font></p>
