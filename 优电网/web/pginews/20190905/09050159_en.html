								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The North Star Transmission and Distribution Network News: The "Thirteenth Five-Year Plan" is the decisive period for China to build a well-off society in an all-round way. Deepening the period of reform is also an important opportunity for the power industry to accelerate its transformation and development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In November 2016, the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration issued the “13th Five-Year Plan for Power Development” (hereinafter referred to as “Planning”), proposing the power development target for 2016-2020. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In line with the optimization and adjustment of the 13th Five-Year Plan for National Electric Power Development, the China Electricity Council established a mid-term evaluation and rolling optimization study for the 13th Five-Year Plan for power development in 2018, and finally formed the “Electric Power Development”. The “Fundamental Evaluation Report on the Mid-term Evaluation and Rolling Optimization Research of the Plan” was submitted to the relevant departments of the central government and the state. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This report combines the new situation and new challenges faced by China's power development, and conducts an in-depth analysis of major issues affecting the high-quality development of power, and puts forward proposals for optimizing the 13th Five-Year Plan for power development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This paper is excerpted from the "Special Research Report on the Mid-term Evaluation and Rolling Optimization Research of the 13th Five-Year Plan for Power Development".</font></font></p>

								<p><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mid-term evaluation of the 13th Five-Year Plan for Power Development</font></font></b></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Main result</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The scale of electricity has reached a new level. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2017, the total electricity consumption of the whole society reached 6.36 trillion kWh, and the power generation capacity reached 1.78 billion kilowatts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The 110 kV and above lines total 1.34 million kilometers, and the substation capacity is 10.7 billion kVA. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China's per capita installed capacity reached 1.28 kW, and the annual per capita electricity consumption was about 4,538 kWh, which is 1.5 times the world average.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Structural adjustments have achieved new results. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The proportion of non-fossil power installations increased from 34.2% at the end of 2015 to 38.7%. The proportion of non-fossil energy in primary energy consumption increased from 12.0% to 13.8%. Non-fossil energy development has entered a large-scale “incremental replacement” stage.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Energy conservation and emission reduction have reached new levels. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the first two years of the "13th Five-Year Plan", the small thermal power units were shut down about 10 million kilowatts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the past two years, the implementation of energy-saving renovation was about 300 million kilowatts. The average coal consumption of coal-fired power plants was reduced from 318 grams of standard coal/kWh in 2015 to 312 grams of standard coal/kWh, and carbon dioxide emissions were 74 million tons. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2017, the total emissions of pollutants such as soot, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in the power industry decreased by 1.6 million tons compared with 2015.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Technological innovation has made new breakthroughs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nuclear power, ultra-supercritical power generation, and new energy power generation have made positive progress. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">±800 kV UHV DC transmission capacity increased from 6.4 million kilowatts to 10 million kilowatts; ±1100 kV, 12 million kilowatts Zhundong-Weinan UHV DC project, the world's first UHV multi-terminal hybrid DC project Wudongde power station to Guangdong The construction of the Guangxi project started.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">International cooperation opens up new prospects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the 52 countries along the “Belt and Road”, the investment business and project contracting projects were carried out. In the first two years of the “13th Five-Year Plan”, 314 large-scale contracted projects were undertaken, with a contractual value of US$58.1 billion, which has driven China’s power generation and transmission and transformation technologies and equipment. Going out of standards, finance, and becoming a “One Belt, One Road” investment highlight.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The power reform has opened a new chapter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The province's transmission and distribution prices have been verified. By the end of 2017, three batches and 291 projects have been launched in the pilot of incremental power distribution business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The market trading mechanism has gradually improved, and the scale of trading in the power market has grown rapidly.</font></font></p>
								<p><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Implementation of the “13th Five-Year” Power Plan</font></font></b></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After two years of development in the "13th Five-Year Plan", China's power industry has achieved remarkable results, and relevant important targets (indicators) have been promoted or exceeded in accordance with the plan. Some of the objectives need to be combined with the implementation of the new requirements of the central government, adapt to the new development situation, and make timely adjustments and adjustments.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Electricity supply and demand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the first two years of the “Thirteenth Five-Year Plan”, the electricity consumption of the whole society increased by 5.7% annually, which was higher than the planned growth rate range (3.6% to 4.8%). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The national power generation installed capacity grew at an average annual rate of 7.9%, higher than the planned annual growth rate (5.5%).</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Power structure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the end of 2017, non-fossil energy power generation accounted for 38.7%, up 3 percentage points from 2015, and less than 1 percentage point from the planning target (39% in 2020); non-fossil energy generation accounted for by 2015 27% increased to 30%, which is only 1 percentage point away from the planning target (31% in 2020). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the power supply installation, solar power generation exceeded the target of 110 million kilowatts in advance three years ahead of schedule, and nuclear power increased by 9 million kilowatts in two years, lagging behind the planning progress.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Power grid construction. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the first two years of the “Thirteenth Five-Year Plan”, the national infrastructure added 500 kV and above AC transmission lines with a length of 24,700 km and substation equipment capacity of 277 million kVA, respectively, completing 27% and 30% of the 2020 target. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The UHV AC-DC project incorporated into the National Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan was fully completed.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Adjustment ability. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the end of 2017, the installed capacity of pumped storage power stations nationwide was 28.69 million kilowatts, and 1/3 of the newly added target of 17 million kilowatts was completed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The flexible transformation of thermal power units in the “13th Five-Year Plan” has been well implemented, especially in the northeast region, and the compensation measures for auxiliary services have been introduced simultaneously. The flexibility transformation has progressed smoothly and the peaking capacity has reached the international advanced level.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Energy conservation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From 2015 to 2017, the average coal consumption of coal-fired power plants decreased from 318 grams of standard coal to 312 grams of standard coal per kilowatt-hour (planned to reduce to 310 grams of standard coal per kilowatt-hour in 2020); the overall line loss rate of power grids from 2015 6.64% fell to 6.49% in 2016 and 6.42% in 2017, achieving the planned goal ahead of schedule (within 6.5% control in 2020).</font></font></p>
								<p><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Several key issues in power quality development and planning adjustment recommendations</font></font></b></p>
								<p><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moderately increase the power demand target</font></font></b></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China is still in the late stage of industrialization and urbanization. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Compared with developed countries, China's per capita electricity consumption is still relatively low, especially in the tertiary industry and residential electricity consumption is only 28%. With the acceleration of electrification, “electric energy substitution” continues to advance, and China's electricity demand in the future There is still room for growth.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is recommended to moderately increase the power demand target. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The target of electricity consumption for the whole society in 2020 will be increased to about 7.6 trillion kWh. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During the “Thirteenth Five-Year Plan” period, the annual growth rate of power demand reached 5.9%, and the elasticity coefficient of power consumption reached 0.92. By 2020, the annual electricity consumption per capita reached 5,200 kWh, which is close to the level of moderately developed countries. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is predicted that in 2035, the whole society will use 11.4 trillion kWh of electricity, and the average annual growth rate will be 2.8% from 2020 to 2035. The per capita electricity consumption is equivalent to the level of the OECD countries in the 1980s.</font></font></p>
								<p><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Promote hydropower development and consumption</font></font></b></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The development potential of hydropower in Southwest China is huge. The proportion of hydropower to be developed is over 67%. The degree of hydropower development is far lower than that of developed countries. In recent years, hydropower projects have been significantly reduced, and hydropower investment has shown a downward trend.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Southwest hydropower development and consumption have also exposed some problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, the phenomenon of abandoning water is more prominent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Second, the overall planning and management of the river basin is relatively weak. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Third, the implementation of the responsibility of the resettlement main body is not in place, and the planning is not binding. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fourth, the tax and fee policy is not reasonable, and the tax burden of hydropower enterprises is too high. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fifth, the difficulty in the development of hydropower is increasing, the policy costs are rising, and the competitiveness of hydropower is gradually decreasing.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To achieve the goal of hydropower development, we must make overall plans to promote the high-quality development of hydropower in the southwest. It is necessary to strengthen unified planning and overall coordination to achieve greater scale of water and electricity consumption; strengthen the overall planning and construction of water and current areas, improve the overall efficiency of the basin; and strengthen immigration management. Effectively implement hydropower resettlement; improve water and electricity tax and fee policies, promote the healthy development of hydropower enterprises; increase financial policy support, and accelerate the construction of hydropower in the southwest.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is recommended that hydropower still maintain its development target of 340 million kilowatts in 2020. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is necessary to start construction of a certain scale of hydropower in the "13th Five-Year Plan" and beyond. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accelerate the development of hydropower in the middle and lower reaches of the Nujiang River, the upper reaches of the Jinsha River and the upper reaches of the Minjiang River, accelerate the early demonstration of the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin, and coordinate the development of hydropower in various basins, and strive to achieve 480 million kilowatts of hydropower installed capacity in 2035.</font></font></p>
								<p><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Optimize new energy development and layout</font></font></b></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Due to the limited market consumption in the western part of the western region, insufficient transmission capacity of inter-regional power grids, serious inter-provincial barriers, and imperfect market trading systems, the issue of new energy abandonment is very prominent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since last year, the government has established a renewable energy target guidance system, launched a green certificate trading mechanism, and formulated an implementation plan to solve the problem of abandoned water and abandoned winds. On the enterprise side, the implementation of unified network scheduling, coal power flexibility transformation and assistance Service pilots, temporary spot transactions, etc. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Through the joint efforts of all parties, the problem of abandoning wind and abandoning light has improved, but the problem of abandoning electricity is still serious. The annual abandonment of wind power is 41.9 billion yuan and the photoelectric output is 7.3 billion kWh.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The key to solving the problem of new energy consumption is to improve the system's ability to adjust. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">New energy power generation has randomness, volatility and intermittentness. After a high proportion of access to the power system, the burden of system regulation is increased. The traditional power source not only has to follow the load change, but also balances the output fluctuation of new energy.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">New energy development should adhere to both centralized and distributed, comprehensive consideration of resource endowments, development conditions, technical economy, input and output and other factors, the implementation of large-scale intensive development of clean energy in the northwest, the implementation of distributed power supply flexible economy in the eastern and central regions Development, relying on the large grid to achieve efficient development, configuration and utilization of various types of centralized and distributed clean energy.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is recommended to increase the new energy development goals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2020, the target for wind power and solar power will be adjusted from 210 million yuan and 110 million kilowatts to 220 million yuan and 200 million kilowatts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Multi-pronged measures to solve the problem of new energy consumption, especially to speed up the system's comprehensive adjustment capacity building. In 2035, wind power and photovoltaic installed capacity reached 600 million kilowatts.</font></font></p>
								<p><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Clean coal power market positioning and development principles</font></font></b></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For a long time, coal-fired power installations have been the main power source in China. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The economic advantages of coal-fired power generation are obvious, which is an important factor supporting the low electricity price level in China for a long time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China's coal-fired power generation and emission reduction technologies are in the forefront of the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The power industry consumes 50% of the volume of coal, but it accounts for only about 10% of the total pollutant discharge in the country, and the emission of electric air pollutants is effectively controlled. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China's carbon emission pressure continues to increase, and the scale of coal-fired power development should be controlled to reach the peak as soon as possible.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As new energy sources accelerate development and power consumption characteristics change, the system's demand for peaking capacity will continue to increase. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China has less hydropower stations with regulation capacity and lower gas-electricity ratio. Coal-fired power is the most economical and reliable peak-shaving power supply. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The positioning of coal-fired power in the system will gradually shift from a power-type power source to a power- and power-regulated power source.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the future, China's coal-fired power development should adhere to the principle of “control increment and optimize layout”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Control the increment, that is, strictly control the new scale, prevent the risk of overcapacity of coal power, and meet the power supply with green low-carbon power. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Optimize the layout, that is, moderately arrange coal-electricity integration projects in the western part of the western region to alleviate the contradiction between coal and electricity; strictly control the growth of coal consumption in the eastern and central regions, and arrange coal-fired power projects through “equal replacement”.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is recommended that the target of coal-fired power generation in 2020 will continue to be controlled at around 1.1 billion kilowatts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All regions strictly implement the national requirements for prevention and resolution of overcapacity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The power gap prioritizes cross-province (district) power mutual assistance, while strengthening demand side management, which is reasonably wrong and avoids peaks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Strive to control the installed capacity of coal power in 2030, which is about 1.3 billion kilowatts, reaching its peak.</font></font></p>
								<p><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accelerate the development of gas and electricity</font></font></b></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China's natural gas resources are seriously insufficient. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The remaining recoverable reserves of per capita natural gas are only equivalent to 1/10 of the world average. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Natural gas power generation costs are high. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gas price has a great impact on the cost of power generation. China's development of gas power does not have a cost advantage. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For a long time, China's gas power development mode is unreasonable, and the peaking advantage has not been fully utilized. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The share of cogeneration is high. As of the end of 2017, the country's gas-powered installed capacity was 74.29 million kilowatts, of which more than 70% were cogeneration projects.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is recommended to implement the development mode of natural gas power plants. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2020, the installed capacity will reach 95 million kilowatts. Further measures should be taken to develop peaking power supply as the main development direction of gas and electricity, with a focus on the eastern and central regions with high gas price bearing capacity and the northwest region with rapid development of new energy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, encourage the development of distributed gas and electricity.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Safe development of nuclear power</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China's nuclear power installed capacity and power generation account for a relatively low proportion. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the end of 2017, China's nuclear power plant has a total capacity of 35 million kilowatts, accounting for about 2% of the country's total installed capacity; the annual nuclear power generation capacity of 247.5 billion kilowatt hours, accounting for 3.9% of the total power generation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So far, 14 of the EU's 28 member states have nuclear power, accounting for 27% of the EU's total electricity generation, contributing 50% of low-carbon power.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nuclear power generation technology is mature, low-carbon and efficient, and plays an irreplaceable key role in energy transformation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accelerate the construction of nuclear power to effectively control the scale of coal power.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is recommended to reduce the development goal of nuclear power and increase the scale of nuclear power construction. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Considering the current progress of nuclear power construction, it is proposed to reduce the development target of 2020 from 58 million kilowatts originally planned to 53 million kilowatts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to ensure the power supply, we will determine the development route of nuclear power in China as soon as possible at the national level, speed up the construction of nuclear power in coastal and inland areas, and approve the construction of 8-10 units each year.</font></font></p>
								<p><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Improve power balance and power flow</font></font></b></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Chinese government promises that by 2020 and 2030, non-fossil energy will account for 15% and 20% of primary energy consumption respectively, and carbon emissions will peak until around 2030. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Combined with the above-mentioned power demand forecasting, various power supply development ideas and principles, the power supply structure continues to be optimized, and non-fossil energy power generation and power generation are growing rapidly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2035, non-fossil energy will become the dominant power source for electricity supply. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2020, the country's power supply installed capacity reached 2.1 billion kilowatts, of which non-fossil energy power generation installed capacity of 880 million kilowatts, accounting for 41%, power generation accounted for 33%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2035, the country's total installed capacity of 3.6 billion kilowatts, of which non-fossil energy power generation installed 2.03 billion kilowatts, accounting for 57%, power generation accounted for 50%.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For a long time to come, the eastern and central regions are the main regions for power consumption in China. In 2020 and 2030, the proportion of electricity consumption in the eastern and central regions was 65.4% and 62.5%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accelerate the development of clean energy bases in the western part of the country, reduce the total coal consumption in the eastern and central regions, and continuously shift the focus of energy development to the north and west. Large-scale and long-distance transmission to the eastern and central load areas is an inevitable requirement.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is recommended to increase the scale of power flow from west to east. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2020, the scale of power transmission from west to east will increase from 270 million kilowatts to around 300 million kilowatts.</font></font></p>
								<p><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Improve the development level of the power grid</font></font></b></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, China's regional power grid UHV main grid is in the process of improvement, the development of UHV AC is lagging behind, the structural contradiction of power grid "strong and weak cross-linking" is prominent, multi-DC, large-capacity centralized feed and 500 kV short-circuit current exceeding the standard in the core area To bring risks to the safe operation of the power grid and affect the power transmission efficiency of the power grid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Insufficient capacity allocation across provinces (regions). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To ensure power supply and achieve clean development goals, it is urgent to accelerate the promotion of a number of UHV inter-provincial (regional) transmission projects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The development foundation of smart distribution networks is weak. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The development of urban distribution network lags behind, and there is still a significant gap compared with the international advanced level. The history of rural power grids is relatively low, and the county-level power grid structure is weak.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is recommended to improve the intrinsic safety level and resource allocation capability of the grid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The construction of the Central High-voltage Ring Network Project in Huazhong will promote the North China-Central China Network Strengthening Project and the regional power grid networking project in a timely manner to eliminate potential safety hazards. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Increase Qinghai-Henan UHV DC project, Zhangbei-Xiong (Beijing West) UHV AC project, Yungui Interconnected Passage Project, completed and put into operation by 2020. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Actively promote the UHV DC transmission project of Baihetan, Jinsha River upstream hydropower and Xinjiang, Yu (Dong) Bin (Chang) and other comprehensive energy bases. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">High quality development of smart distribution networks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Strengthen the construction of urban distribution network, improve quality and efficiency, vigorously promote the transformation and upgrading of rural power grids, and improve the intelligence level of distribution networks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Strengthen international energy and power cooperation, establish cross-border power interconnection and cooperation mechanisms with relevant countries, conduct power network planning research and project feasibility studies with key regions such as Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia, and accelerate the interconnection and interconnection of neighboring national power grids.</font></font></p>
								<p><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Strengthen the construction of comprehensive adjustment capacity</font></font></b></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Give priority to the implementation of coal-electricity flexibility transformation, increase the construction of pumped storage and gas-fired peak-shaving power supply, actively promote the commercial operation of energy storage technology, strengthen demand-side management, and guide users to use scientific electricity to meet the needs of large-scale development of new energy in China.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Implementing coal power flexibility transformation is a realistic choice to improve the system's ability to adjust. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, the maturity and economy of energy storage technology are not yet available for large-scale commercial application. Pumped storage power stations are constrained by site resources, and the economy is poor (investment of 6,000 yuan per kilowatt), gas and gas are affected by gas and gas. Price restrictions do not have large-scale construction conditions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The coal-electricity flexibility transformation technology is mature, and the cost per kilowatt is about 120~400 yuan. Some domestic power plants have started the pilot project of deep peaking and transformation, and achieved the expected results.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is recommended to emphasize the capacity building of peaks and improve system flexibility. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The implementation of coal-electricity flexibility transformation shall be carried out in an orderly manner according to the sub-regional and sub-unit capacity. For the “Three North” areas where new energy consumption is difficult, 300,000 kilowatts and below, some 600,000 kilowatt coal-fired power units will be flexibly modified, and Synchronously introduce an auxiliary service compensation mechanism. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deepen power demand side management. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Give full play to the advantages of the information system, strengthen the construction of the smart grid system platform, foster the power service industry, improve the flexibility of the power user side; expand the scope of peak and valley time-of-use electricity prices, and formulate scientific and reasonable peak-to-valley time-of-use electricity prices.</font></font></p>
								<p><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Actively promote power reform and marketization</font></font></b></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The electricity market is a soft channel for realizing the optimal allocation of power resources across the country. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China's power market reform has made positive progress, but the problem of inter-provincial barriers is still prominent, and the formation mechanism of electricity prices is imperfect, which restricts the efficiency of large-scale allocation of power resources.</font></font></p>
								<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is recommended to improve and improve the policy mechanism. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accelerate the establishment of a transparent and efficient national and provincial power market platform, break the inter-provincial barriers, and give full play to the role of the market in the allocation of energy resources. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Improve the auxiliary service mechanism and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of power companies and users to participate in auxiliary services through market-based means. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Improve and start the coal-electricity linkage mechanism to rationally guide coal-fired power generation costs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Formulate and implement flexible electricity price policies and actively promote electric energy substitution.</font></font></p>
