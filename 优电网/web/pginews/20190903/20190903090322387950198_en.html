If it is considered to send hydropower to the southwest, it is necessary Carry out long distance transmission. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China’s earlier large-scale experiment was called West Power Transmission. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The typical Yangtze River Three Gorges water conservancy project was painted by a picture that sounded very fascinating, saying that the electricity it emitted could "illuminate most of China." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This actually refers to its power supply radius, that is to say, the power of the Three Gorges can travel through most of China. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this coverage requires a platform, which is the transmission line. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The eastern coastal cities can use clean energy from the Three Gorges, mainly due to the power transmission from the West to the East. In other words, China's power grid has already had a large range of power resource allocation capabilities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Generally speaking, China's large energy bases are more than 1,000 kilometers away from the load centers of the eastern and central regions, and some even reach 3,000 kilometers. In fact, they have exceeded the economic transmission distance of traditional ultra-high voltage transmission lines. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This problem has more or less existed in countries around the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A large power grid characterized by UHV can solve this problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From this perspective, whether or not to build a UHV grid is determined by the distribution characteristics of China's energy resources.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The biggest feature of the UHV grid is that it can greatly improve the transmission capacity of the grid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, a one-circuit UHV DC grid can deliver 6 million kilowatts of electricity, which is four to five times the current 500 kilovolt DC grid, and the power transmission distance is two to three times that of the latter, which is efficiency. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, after measuring, the same amount of power can be delivered. If the UHV line is used, it can save 60% of the land resources compared with the 500 kV high-voltage line. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of eliminating clean energy in the southwest, the advantages of UHV power grids are also quite obvious. Taking hydropower as an example, UHV grids can expand the water consumption market in southwestern China to the central and eastern load centers, which can achieve mutual benefits and reduce abandonment. Water power. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each reduction of water abandonment of 19.6 billion kWh can replace 6.66 million tons of standard coal, reduce carbon dioxide by 16.61 million tons, sulfur dioxide by 0.78 million tons, nitrogen oxides by 86,600 tons, and emission reduction of 0.2 million tons. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Both theoretically and technically, the UHV grid has the ability to send large amounts of wind power from Northeast China, North China, and Northwest China to the East Central Load Center to reduce wind. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Similarly, solar energy in the Midwest can also be transported over long distances in the same way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, UHV technology has the advantage of UHV technology and can </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">play an important role in the construction of </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">global </font></font><a target="_blank" href="http://shupeidian.bjx.com.cn/zt.asp?topic=%c4%dc%d4%b4%bb%a5%c1%aa%cd%f8" title="Energy Internet News"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">energy Internet</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The earliest UHV line in China was completed in January 2009. It is an UHV AC project from Shanxi Nanyang, Henan Province, to Jingmen, Hubei, with a voltage rating of 1000 kV. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We usually call it "1000 kV Jindongnan-Nanyang-Jingmen UHV AC Pilot Demonstration Project". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Compared with several ultra-long-distance lines built later, although it has a transmission distance of only 640 kilometers, it is the world's first UHV project to be put into commercial operation. It is because of its operation that it has realized North China and Central China. UHV cross-zone networking. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, it is reasonable to draw more attention from the operation of this line. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, Premier Wen Jiabao of the State Council once issued a special notice: "The UHV AC pilot demonstration project has been commissioned, marking a major breakthrough in the localization of UHV core technologies and equipment for long-distance, large-capacity, and low-loss. It is of great significance to ensure national energy security and reliable supply of electricity. It is necessary to organize the project acceptance work to ensure the safe and stable operation of the project.” The Secretary General of the International Power Grid Committee (CIGRE) Jean Coval is also called this UHV AC pilot demonstration project. The operation of "is an important milestone in the history of the development of the power industry."</font></font></p><p><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whether China wants to build UHV has been controversial</font></font></strong></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the construction of UHV power grids has been controversial. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even when the first line has been successfully put into operation, the voice of opposition is still endless. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a saying that since the UHV project is said to be related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, the investment is so huge. Compared with the Yangtze River Three Gorges Project, why did it not be submitted to the National People's Congress for voting? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are also a few people who hold this view by my side. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For this question, the answer of the late academician Pan Jiaxuan, a famous hydropower expert, seems quite intriguing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Over the years, countless major projects in the country, such as the "West-East Gas Transmission" and "Qinghai-Tibet Railway", have not been voted by the National People's Congress. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The UHV project is a big project in the current national construction project, but it is not a one-time investment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not taking a vote at a people's congress does not mean being careless. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, UHV is still engaged in experimental demonstration projects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When Pan Jiaxuan said this, the UHV test project was just launched. It should be said that as a highly respected hydropower expert, Pan Jiaxuan's support is very valuable, and it has also eliminated some of the concerns of some waiters.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, Pan Jiaxuan asked whether or not to apply for UHV in China. Some Western countries have built UHVs without extensive promotion and have their own views. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Looking back now, Pan Jiayu’s views are both strategic and professional. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pan Jiaxuan admits that UHV is a very complicated technology and has a strong professionalism. Although his major is not an UHV, he has something to say. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Pan Jiaxuan's view, China should not go to Matt High. The first thing to look at is whether it is necessary or necessary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some countries, like France and the United Kingdom, have a small land area, so there is no need to carry out UHV. As for Japan, it is an island country. Although it has carried out UHV, it mainly wants to use the practice of UHV engineering to drive the technology of electrician equipment manufacturing. The development will prepare for the occupation of this international market in the future. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the perspective of long-term development, Pan Jiaxuan believes that it is necessary for China to engage in UHV. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It depends on China's national conditions. China has a large territory, but the energy distribution is uneven. Hydropower and coal power resources are mainly concentrated in the west and southwest, leaving the economic center one or two thousand kilometers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is also Tibet Hydropower, Xinjiang coal and electricity, development is a matter of time, what is it to send out? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From this perspective alone, China has the necessity and need to develop UHV, and it is ready to take the initiative early. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We can't do it because we haven't done it, or we don't dare to do it.</font></font></p><p><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China enters the era of UHV grid</font></font></strong></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since August 2006, the first UHV project, namely the 1000 kV Jindongnan-Nanyang-Jingmen UHV AC pilot demonstration project started construction. By the end of 2018, China has built 22 UHVs with “eight crosses and fourteen straight”. The project is under construction for nine UHV projects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The ability of UHV grids to transport over long distances is being validated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among them, Xiangjiaba-Shanghai ±800 kV UHV DC transmission demonstration project, the delivery end is located in Sichuan Xiangjiaba Fulong Converter Station, the receiving end is located in Shanghai Fengxian Converter Station, the line length is 1907 km, passing through Sichuan, Chongqing, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai and other eight provinces and cities basically cover the most important areas of the Yangtze River basin. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This UHV transmission channel, referred to by the industry as “upward DC”, has delivered Sichuan hydropower to Shanghai totaling 93.9 billion kWh in the five years since its commissioning in July 2010, equivalent to saving 43.02 million tons of coal. It has reduced emissions of 34,000 tons of soot, 212,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, 224,000 tons of nitrogen oxides and 84.51 million tons of carbon dioxide. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As the clean water source connecting China's southwest hydropower base and the eastern load center, the Xiluodu left bank-Zhejiang Jinhua ±800 kV UHV DC transmission project has been cleaned by the UHV grid since it was officially put into operation in July 2014. The proportion of clean energy supply in Zhejiang increased by 21.27%.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same as the "upward DC" and "Xizhe DC" is the Jinping-Sunan ±800 kV DC UHV transmission project. This line was put into operation at the end of 2012. It starts from Xilong Yulong Converter Station in Xichang, Sichuan. It is to Suzhou Converter Station in Tongli, Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province. The total length of the line is 2059 kilometers, the rated voltage is ±800 kV, and the rated transmission power is 7.2 million kilowatts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that time, as the world's largest transport capacity, the farthest transmission distance, the highest voltage level and other series of DC transmission world record holders, once quite beautiful. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But just three years later, this record was refreshed by another, even more surprising, UHV line.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On September 30, 2018, the Zhundong-Weinan ±1100 kV UHV DC transmission project was put into operation. This line is called the world's highest voltage level, the largest transmission capacity, the longest transportation distance, and the most advanced technology. UHV transmission project. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It started in Changji Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang, and the terminal is located in Xuancheng City, Anhui Province. It passes through Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Henan and Anhui provinces. It has two new converter stations in Zhundong and Weinan with a commutation capacity of 24 million kilowatts. The total length is 3,324 kilometers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Its biggest highlight is the successful breakthrough of ±800 kV DC transmission technology, achieving a new leap of ±1100 kV voltage level, voltage level ±800 rise to ±1100 kV, and the transmission capacity increased from 6.4 million kilowatts to 1200 Ten thousand kilowatts, the economic transmission distance has increased to 3,000 to 5,000 kilometers, and the transmission loss per kilometer has dropped to about 1.5%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The project successfully developed key equipment such as ±1100 kV converter transformer and converter valve. For the first time, it adopts ±1100 kV indoor DC field and feed end commutation field assembly scheme. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The comprehensive benefits of this line are encouraging, with a transmission capacity of 12 million kilowatts and an annual transmission of 66 billion kWh to East China. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to this power transmission, it can light 400 million watts of 30 watts.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before the construction of the Zhundong-Weinan project, the first channel of “Jiangsu Power Delivery”, namely the Hamiltonian-Zhengzhou UHV project, has been put into operation, with a total transmission capacity of 38.3 billion kWh, accounting for more than 90% of the Xinjiang power transmission scale. . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Zhundong-Weinan project is also the second UHV transmission project of “Jiangsu Power Delivery”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the energy map of China, Xinjiang has the conditions to simultaneously develop coal, wind and solar power. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The quality of coal resources in Zhundong area is good and the development conditions are good. It is suitable for local power generation. The proven coal reserves are about 213.6 billion tons. The coal, water and environment conditions can be combined. The planned coal production capacity in 2020 can support the scale of coal-fired power installation. It is 40 million kilowatts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Xinjiang is also one of the nine large wind power bases planned and constructed by the state. The wind power technology can be developed over 200 million kilowatts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the end of 2014, the installed capacity of thermal power, wind power and solar power in Xinjiang reached 3,200, 800, and 3.7 million kilowatts respectively. The local installed capacity was large. Due to the limitation of transmission capacity and corridor resources, the existing transmission channels could not meet large-scale power. delivery. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The construction of the Zhundong-Weinan project and the implementation of the “transportation of Xinjiang Power” will help promote the intensive development of the Xinjiang energy base, promote the joint delivery of thermal power, wind power and solar power, improve the efficiency of resource utilization, and expand the scope of new energy consumption. It will effectively promote the transformation of local resource advantages into economic advantages.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the investment estimate, the investment in the Zhundong-Hainan project will exceed 40 billion yuan, which will increase the output value of the power transmission and transformation equipment manufacturing industry by 28.5 billion yuan, directly driving the related industries such as power supply and investment of about 100 billion yuan, and increasing the number of jobs by 28,000. GDP will increase by 13 billion yuan and tax revenue will increase by 2.4 billion yuan. It will drive the transformation and upgrading of the equipment manufacturing industry and become the "power silk road" connecting the western frontier and eastern China.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first UHV demonstration project was completed in 2009. In the past ten years, we have looked back at UHV from the brewing, start-up and construction, and gradually formed the energy source of “West-East Power Transmission, Nortel South Supply, Water and Fire, and Wind and Light” in China. The new Internet structure has met the needs of a wider range of optimal allocation of energy resources, and has become an important force in promoting energy transformation and upgrading, creating a new level of China's power technology innovation.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This article is published in "Contemporary Power Culture", 2019, 2007.
