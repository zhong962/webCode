            <h1 style="letter-spacing: 0PX;">In response to the suggestion of NPC deputies to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas, no consideration was given to canceling the certification of "Chinese Students Drinking Milk" sign</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 12px; color:gray;width: 90%;margin-left: 40px;letter-spacing: 0PX;">In response to a proposal by a representative of the National People's Congress to cancel the "Chinese Students Drinking Milk" logo certification, the Agricultural Reclamation Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs recently responded that the "Chinese Students Drinking Milk" certification is conducive to promoting the national student drinking milk program, and has not considered canceling the "Chinese Students Drinking Milk" logo certification.<br></p>
            <p style="letter-spacing: 0PX;">
                    &emsp; it is understood that on August 29, 2000, the former Ministry of Agriculture and other seven ministries and bureaus jointly launched the implementation of the National Milk Drinking Program for Students. On September 5, 2013, the former Ministry of Agriculture and other seven departments jointly issued the Notice on the Adjustment of the Promotion Mode of the Students'Drinking Milk Program, which transferred the promotion of the students' drinking milk program to the China Dairy Association as a whole. Data show that by the end of 2018, the average daily supply of milk for students was over 18 million, benefiting 22 million primary and secondary school students, covering 60,000 schools in 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government. <br>

                    &emsp; the relevant personnel of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs believe that the use of the "Chinese Students Drinking Milk" sign is conducive to establishing the brand image of Chinese students drinking milk and promoting the implementation of the national students drinking milk program. It is understood that enterprises applying for the use of the logo need to undergo a number of tests and assessments before the comprehensive assessment meets the requirements for registration. The label will be applied voluntarily by dairy enterprises and used free of charge with the permission of China Dairy Association. <br>
                    
                    &emsp; students drinking milk is a collective and centralized drinking of primary and secondary school students in school. The particularity of groups and occasions determines that it is different from the consumption of general dairy products. The production enterprise of students'drinking milk is the supplier of students' drinking milk and bears the main responsibility of food safety. It is understood that since the Chinese Dairy Association undertook the promotion of the National Student Drinking Milk Program, it has adhered to the principles of "safety first, quality first, strict access, orderly competition, standardized management, and sound promotion", insisted on putting food safety in the first place in the promotion work, and the requirements for the production enterprises of students'drinking milk are higher than those of ordinary milk. Product enterprises. Dairy enterprises applying for the label "Chinese Students Drinking Milk" must possess the production sites, facilities, equipment layout, technological process, rules, regulations and techniques stipulated by the Food Safety Law of the People's Republic of China, the Regulations on Supervision and Administration of Dairy Quality and Safety, relevant laws and regulations and the national food safety standards. On the premise of basic conditions such as technical management personnel and quality assurance system, higher requirements are also put forward in processing capacity, quality management, milk source base, distribution system and management system, so as to ensure the quality and safety of students'drinking milk. <br>
                    
                    &emsp; the current promotion of students'drinking milk products includes two categories: raw milk as raw material processing, super-high temperature sterilized milk without or without adding reconstituted milk, raw milk as the main raw material processing, and sterilized milk without or without adding reconstituted milk and nutritional fortifier. According to the nutritional improvement needs of students and the development of dairy industry, the students'milk drinking program will increase the product categories in time. "Nutrition assessment and risk assessment should be carried out before the implementation of the adjustment. Pilot projects should be carried out first, and propelled steadily. Standards should be formulated after summing up experience before they can be formally promoted." The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said. <br>
                    
                    It is understood that, in order to provide students with safe and nutritious high-quality milk, the Chinese Dairy Association has promulgated a series of group standards for students'drinking milk, including "students' drinking raw milk" and "students'drinking milk purity", in accordance with the standard of large-scale dairy farms at a higher level of production in China and the advanced standards of developed countries in the dairy industry. Milk, Sterilized Milk for Drinking Milk for Students, Milk Mark for Drinking Milk for Chinese Students, and Standards for Management of Milk Source Base for Drinking Milk for Students to Guarantee the Production and Supply of Raw Milk. According to the promotion and management measures of the National "Student Drinking Milk Program" of the China Dairy Association, the source base of milk for students and the products for students to drink milk must meet the above group standards. This series of standards is based on the implementation of national standards, docking with advanced international standards, and putting forward higher requirements, which are different from the general dairy products sold in the market. <br> </p></div>
