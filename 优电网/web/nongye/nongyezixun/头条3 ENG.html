                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color:gray;width: 90%;margin-left: 40px;letter-spacing: 0PX">As we all know, Qinghai is one of the five pastoral areas in China. It has unique natural environment conditions, so it also has the largest number of yaks with the best quality in the world. What happens to yaks without "soul antennae"? Recently, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the capital of the world yak, has done another "cow" thing. After more than 20 years of scientific research and independent innovation, the world's first hornless yak, Ashdan, was successfully bred by Lanzhou Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and Datong Cattle Farm, Qinghai Province.<br></p>
                            　　<p style="letter-spacing: 0PX">
                                    & emsp; yak was originally a special animal in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. It is a Typical Alpine animal with extremely cold resistance. Primitive yaks survived in the Pleistocene more than 3 million years ago and were widely distributed in northeastern Eurasia. Later, due to crustal movement and climate change, it moved southward to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China, and adapted to the cold climate and continued to evolve into a modern yak. <br>

& emsp; yaks are all treasures, high meat protein, lean meat, strong game, its wool fiber slender, flexible texture, herdsmen used to weave small tents, warm in winter and cool in summer, wind and water proof, durable, soft and comfortable velvet, for high-grade wool. Its leather can be made of exquisite leather, rich in luster, elegant material, for the leather of the first-class goods. Its bone is boiled to make bone glue, transparent and clear, strong stickiness and wide use. <br>

& emsp; yak is no ordinary cattle, dairy cattle, an adult male yak can weigh up to 440 kilograms, the body is tall, hair is not only shiny, and the length is almost vertical. <br>

& emsp; statistics show that there are nearly 16 million Yaks in the world, including more than 15 million in China, which is the country with the largest number of yaks and breeds in the world, accounting for more than 95% of the total number of Yaks in the world. <br>

& emsp; China is the birthplace of the world yak, 90% of the world yak live in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and six adjacent provinces. Qinghai Province has a total area of 720,000 square kilometers, with pastoral areas over 3000 meters above sea level accounting for 96% of the province's total area, and natural grassland area of 547 million mu, of which 480,970,000 yaks are kept, accounting for 32% of the world's yaks, ranking first in the country. <br><h3>为什么要培育无角牦牛</h3><br>
                            　　<p style="font-size: 12px; color:gray;width: 90%;margin-left: 40px;letter-spacing: 0PX">
                                    The breeding of hornless breeds is a hotspot in livestock breeding and improvement all over the world. The world is famous for Scottish Angus cattle and American hornless short horned cattle. Someone can't help asking, "Do yaks without horns have souls?"<br>
                            　　</p><p style="letter-spacing: 0PX">
                                    &emsp, deputy director of Lanzhou Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yan Ping, head of yak resources and breeding innovation team, introduced that with the diversification of traditional feeding methods, horned yaks exposed mutual harm, difficulty in feeding and destruction of enclosures in large-scale and intensive feeding. <br>

&emsp; don't believe it, in Datong Cattle Farm, Qinghai Province, the world's largest Yak with 1190 kg had a "fight incident" with its companions, and died in 2017. <br>

In order to further enrich and develop the improved yak breeding system, Datong Breeding Farm of Qinghai Province and Lanzhou Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences carried out the cultivation of new hornless yak varieties in 1993. After more than 20 years of unremitting efforts, the "Ashdan" Yak with excellent meat production performance was bred. On April 28, 2009, in the agricultural countryside. The new yak breed approved by the Ministry is the second artificially bred yak breed in the world after Datong Yak.

<br>& emsp; "Ashdan" yak compared with other yak breeds, mild temperament, not easy to fight, easy to raise, easy to manage, while naturally reducing the injury rate can increase the feeding density, easy to house feeding. The genetic basis and physique characteristics of the new yak varieties are obviously different from the 17 local yak breeds in China.

<br>& Emsp; "Ashdan" yak breeding is of great significance to the large-scale intensive standardized breeding of yaks on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, to meet the diversified needs of yak breeds in China, to make full use of the forage resources in the alpine and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and to speed up the efficiency of yak industry, to increase production and herdsmen's income. It fills in the blank of yak feeding in hornless house as the main breed and marks a breakthrough in animal breeding in China.</p><br><h3>培育技术创新亮点频现</h3>
                            　　<p style="margin-top:-15px; letter-spacing: 0PX"><br>
                                &emsp;Bao Guangcai, deputy director of Datong Breeding Farm in Qinghai Province, told Sci-tech Daily that the new yak variety "Ashdan" meets the diversified needs of yak breeding in China and provides differential varieties for large-scale, intensive and standardized yak breeding. Its production performance and comprehensive quality have reached the leading level of yak in the same type of ecological region in the world, leading the breeding direction of ecological differentiation of yak breeds in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China, providing a successful model for breeding yak breeds in the unique ecological region of the world, and fully demonstrating the international leading position of China in yak genetics and breeding discipline direction. Position.
                            　　<br>&emsp; it is reported that the breeding technology of "Ashdan" yak breaks through the technical bottleneck of molecular marker-assisted selection in identifying variant loci of angular traits, and systematically studies the morphology and histology of yak horn development for the first time. The early selection of yak horn traits by identifying genotypes of P1ID and P219ID loci shortened the breeding cycle, improved the breeding efficiency and accelerated the breeding process, and its breeding technology ranked the leading level at home and abroad.

							<br>In addition, Datong Breeding Farm in Qinghai Province has established an open core population breeding system and four-level breeding system of bull breeding station, breeding core population, breeding population and extension demonstration area, which has accelerated genetic evaluation and genetic exchange of breeding cattle and accelerated the construction of improved breed breeding, breeding system and yak breeding system in China. The change of feeding mode has important practical significance.</p><br><h3>无角牦牛“能量非凡”</h3>
                            　　<p style="margin-top:-15px; padding-bottom: 20px;letter-spacing: 0PX;" ><br>
                                & emsp; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the highest altitude plateau in the world. It is called "the roof of the world", "the third pole of the earth" and "the water tower of Asia". The ecological environment is very important. The "Ashdan" yak has solved the problems of yak farming, such as long-term dependence on natural grassland for dispersed grazing, single production mode, low industrial scale, intensive, standardization, low production efficiency and weak market competitiveness. It breaks through the seasonal situation of traditional grazing and breeding mode, improves the structure of yak farming in alpine pastoral area of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, such as grazing, grazing plus supplementary feeding and complete house feeding, and improves the development level of yak industry in the cold and arid ecological area of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

<br>& emsp; Bao Guangcai also introduced that "Ashdan" yak has good meat production performance, strong resistance, high reproductive performance, high economic efficiency, convenient for intensive breeding, and is welcomed by herdsmen. During the period of cultivation, 3950 bulls were popularized to Qinghai and Gansu provinces and regions to improve local yaks. Under the same feeding conditions, the average survival rate of improved offspring was 59.98%, which was 11.72 percentage points higher than that of local yaks; the mortality rate was 1.24%, which was 4.32 percentage points lower than that of local yaks; the average weight of 18-month-old offspring was 92.77 kg, which was 18.38 kg higher than that of local Yaks of the same age, and increased by 24.71%. The yield and efficiency of improved offspring were remarkable. The Tibetan people cannot live without yaks, which are an important source of livelihood and economy for the people of the plateau. The "Ashdan" yak will also play an important role in helping ethnic minority areas out of poverty and in supporting rural revitalization. </p></p></div>
