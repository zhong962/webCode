Liu Fei-bian, a big grain producer in Hao Village, said as he bent down and pulled out a wheat seedling: "You see, there are seven or eight tillers, how delightful they are."

<br>& emsp; not to lose the good spring, hope that the field will flourish. Data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas show that this year's winter wheat area is stable, growing better than last year's, and the summer grain harvest is expected.

The more complex the economic situation is, the more important it is to attach importance to agriculture, countryside and farmers.</h3>
									<p style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom: 15px;letter-spacing: 0px;">
											General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that 2019 is the key year to win the goal of building a well-off society in an all-round way for the first century. It is of great significance to do a good job in the work of "agriculture, countryside and farmers" to effectively deal with various risks and challenges, and to ensure sustainable and healthy economic development and social stability.

											<br>&emsp; from the central government to the local government, adhere to the priority of agricultural and rural development, and play the policy of "combination boxing". In the first quarter of this year, the added value of the primary industry reached 876.9 billion yuan, an increase of 2.7% over the same period last year, and the per capita disposable income of rural residents reached 4600 yuan, an increase of 6.9% in real terms, continuing the good momentum of "double growth".
											
											<br>&emsp; looking at quality behind the numbers, agricultural production is "getting better" and "turning green", and the development momentum is stronger.
											
											<br>&emsp; tuning structure. "What and how?" Old questions have new answers. "Early this year under the subsidy, we also grow organic rice, good value, cost-effective!" Yan Jingwu, a farmer in Southwest Village of Suihua City, Heilongjiang Province, said frankly. Looking at the whole country, the policy of "baton" guidance, more adjustments, less adjustments, non-dominant areas to reduce corn, increase the market shortage of high-quality varieties, this year will develop grain to feed an area of more than 12 million mu. The retreat, the reduction, rotation and fallow farming will pilot 30 million mu, so that more arable land "breathe". Addition and subtraction in the field, in exchange for a good brand of industrial layout.
											
											<br>&emsp; adjustment system. Agriculture goes beyond farming and cultivation to the integration of one, two and three crops. A large number of provincial, municipal and county-level industrial parks have been created by the state-level modern agricultural industrial parks, and more agricultural products are leaving the "original name" quickly. Henan Central Plains Granary, a grain "eats dry and squeezes clean", has become hundreds of products, and grain production capacity has become a processing advantage. In the first quarter of this year, the business income of agricultural products processing enterprises above the scale was 3.7 trillion yuan, an increase of 5.8% over the same period last year. New industries and new formats are bursting out, and the motive force in the field is more abundant.
											
											<br>&emsp; keep the bottom line. "Food in hand, not panic in mind," the national delimitation of 1.016 billion mu "two zones" (functional areas for grain production and important agricultural products production protection zones), to complete 96% of the delimitation tasks. Precise policy implementation, agriculture, water resources, finance and other funds to concentrate efforts to create a "one-season kilograms, two-season tons of grain" of high-standard farmland. Keeping the "two districts" in good order can guarantee 95% of Chinese grain rations, 90% of cereals, 60% of sugar cane, etc. and stabilize the basic plate of effective supply of grain and other important agricultural products.
											
											<br>&emsp; standing in the overall view of rural areas, Rural Revitalization has been accelerated in an all-round way, more villages have "beauty" and "temperament" to inject vigorous vitality.
											
											<br>&emsp; a toilet revolution, lit up the "beautiful economy" of Douzhai Village, Leishan County, Guizhou Province. The "May Day" Xiaochang Rockery Village is very popular. Song Zhijun, director of the village committee, said unexpectedly, "Pastoral Park, Castle Peak Golden Mountain, beautiful mountain villages can grow new wallets." More than a toilet revolution, more than a Douzhai village! The improvement of rural human settlements in China has been carried out in an all-round way. Real gold and silver have been invested in bringing back green waters and green mountains. A number of civilized villages have been brought to life, good governance of the countryside has become beautiful, and ecological and livable happy homesteads have come at a fast pace. With the integration of urban and rural development, more beautiful countryside has become the backyard of urban people.
											
											<br>&emsp; behind the development of income, farmers no longer rely solely on the soil for food, "four carriages" to pull, more diversified income channels——
											
											<br>&emsp; say 10000, the key to increase farmers'income. Looking at the report card of "agriculture, countryside and farmers" in the first quarter, farmers'operating income will expand new space, play a good "fruit and vegetable brand", sell health and brand, and traditional agriculture will give new connotation; the "main engine" of wage income will be strong, increasing by 9% year on year in the first quarter; property income will enter the fast lane, and farmers will have more dividends and assets. Income; Transfer income security is strong, one subsidy is more accurate, effective, heavy income gift package, reflected in the happy smiling face of farmers'friends.
											
											<br>&emsp; in today's rural China, hundreds of millions of farmers are striving for a better life and feel vigorous pulsation everywhere. Chinese people have more stable rice bowls, more varieties of "vegetable basket", more farmers'pockets, more rural areas "see mountains, see water, remember homesickness"... Keeping the strategic backyard of "agriculture, countryside and farmers" and firmly holding the "ballast stone" of the overall economic and social situation are the absolute strength to deal with various risks and challenges. </p>
