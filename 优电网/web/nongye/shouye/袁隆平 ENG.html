In 1999, an asteroid discovered by Schmidt CCD asteroid project team of Beijing Observatory of Chinese Academy of Sciences was named Yuan Longping. In 2000, he won the highest national science and technology award. In April 2006, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences of America. Foreign academician, won the honorary doctorate degree of Macao University of Science and Technology in 2010.</p>

<br>Yuan Longping was the pioneer and leader in the field of hybrid rice research. He devoted himself to the research, application and popularization of hybrid rice technology. He invented "three-line method" of Indica Hybrid rice, successfully developed "two-line method" of hybrid rice and established the technical system of super hybrid rice. At the same time, Yuan Longping put forward and implemented the "Three Yield and Four High Yield Project", using the technical achievements of super hybrid rice, published 6 Monographs in Chinese and English, and published more than 60 papers. On April 14, 2018, Yuan Longping expressed his views on GM in an interview. For GM soybeans, Yuan Longping pointed out that as long as GM crops passed the safety test, there would be no problem. Yuan Longping said that genetically modified agriculture is the future direction of development.

<br> On September 8, 2018, he won the Life Science Award of the "Future Science Award". On December 18, 2018, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council awarded Yuan Longping the title of pioneer of reform, the pioneer of reform medal and the pioneer of hybrid rice research. In August 2019, it was publicized as the "Medal of the Republic" recommended candidates. 1. Yuan Longping took the lead in utilizing rice heterosis in China. In his first paper, Male Infertility in Rice, he put forward that "if we want to make use of rice heterosis, we should first make use of male infertility". His theory and research practice challenge the classical genetics theory, negate the traditional view that self-pollinating crops such as rice have no heterosis, and greatly enrich the theory and technology of Crop Genetics and breeding.

<br> 2. Yuan Longping solved three difficult problems in the study of three-line hybrid rice. First, the technical scheme of "distant hybridization between wild rice and cultivated rice" was put forward. Finally, an effective way to cultivate male sterile lines was found. In 1973, the "three-line" matching of male sterile lines, maintainer lines and restorer lines was realized. Second, a number of combinations of hybrid rice "Nanyou 2" with strong heterosis were bred and widely used in production, making it the first scientist in the world to successfully utilize rice heterosis. Third, it breaks through the seed production barrier. Past studies have shown that the outcrossing rate of rice is only 2.4%, and the seed yield of hybrid generation is very low, which is far from the production requirements. The International Rice Institute began to study in 1971 and gave up in 1973, because no one believed that the seed production problem could be solved at that time. The research group led by Yuan Longping successfully solved this problem, and seed production has gradually increased. Now the yield has reached more than 300 kilograms per mu.

<br> 3. Yuan Longping put forward the development strategy of hybrid rice breeding, that is, from three lines to two lines and then to one line, the procedure is simpler and more efficient; the level of heterosis is from varieties to subspecies to distant heterosis utilization, and the heterosis is stronger and stronger, which makes hybrid rice step by step to a new step. Enter. This idea has been adopted by domestic and foreign peers and has become the guiding ideology of hybrid rice breeding development.

<br> 4. Yuan Longping solved some key technical problems in the two-system method. For example, in 1989, when the two-line method met with major setbacks, he put forward the starting temperature index and the technical strategy of breeding practical photothermo-sensitive genic male sterile lines to lead to sterility, which made the two-line hybrid rice research out of the trough. Later, some important techniques such as core seed production procedure and cold water tandem irrigation propagation were studied and put forward, which made the research of Two-line Hybrid Rice successful and popularized. Since 1987, he has been an expert on the technical research of Two-line Hybrid Rice in the "863" project, presiding over national collaborative research. In 1995, two-line hybrid rice was successfully studied. The yield of two-line hybrid rice was 5%-10% higher than that of three-line hybrid rice at the same maturity stage.

<br> 5. He designed a super-high yield plant type model with high canopy, low panicle and medium-large panicle, and the technical route of cultivating super hybrid rice, and made great progress in the research of super hybrid rice. In 1997, Yuan Longping carried out the research on Super Hybrid rice. In 2000, 2004 and 2012, the first, second and third stages of 700 kg, 800 kg and 900 kg per mu of super rice demonstration plots in China have been achieved respectively. In 2013, he launched the fourth phase of Super Hybrid Rice with a yield of 1,000 kilograms per mu in 100 mu demonstration plots, and planned to achieve the target by 2020. At the same time, the project of "three crops and four yields" for super hybrid rice was implemented to promote the production and application of scientific and technological achievements. Since 2007, it has achieved tremendous effect of increasing production and income. Seven provinces and municipalities have implemented it in China. Among them, the number of counties (cities and districts) in Hunan Province has increased from 20 to 50 in 2012, with an area of 8.82 million mu. By 2012, the cumulative area of demonstration and extension was more than 20 million mu, and the output was increased by more than 2 billion kilograms, which made new contributions to the sustained and stable increase of grain production.</p>
