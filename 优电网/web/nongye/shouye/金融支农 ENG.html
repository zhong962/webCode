                    [Financial support for agriculture will pilot government purchasing services this year] Rural areas need to be revitalized. Where does the money come from? In order to better play the role of market mechanism and guide financial funds to invest in agriculture and rural areas, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has recently issued a policy to carry out pilot financial support for agriculture innovation through government purchasing services. & emsp; Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Planning and Finance Department has officially issued a paper. This year, the pilot plan is to purchase no more than four eligible innovative pilot services in all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, planned cities and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation and Guangdong Agricultural Reclamation. <br>

                    According to preliminary estimates, the total investment in implementing the strategic plan for Rural Revitalization needs at least 7 trillion yuan in five years. However, China's "three rural" financial services generally have the problem of "two high, one difficult and one slow", that is, high risk, high cost, difficult management and slow effect. Through pioneering and innovative experiments in some areas, the innovative pilot project summarizes the replicable and easy-to-popularize financial support model, establishes reserve for the research and promulgation of major regional and national support policies for agriculture, and promotes better financial services for rural revitalization. <br>
                    
                    &emsp; the pilot project will focus on the urgent needs of farmers, especially the new agricultural business entities, based on breaking the bottleneck of agricultural and rural financial constraints, opening the channels for financial funds to invest in agricultural and rural areas, forming a multi-input pattern with financial focus tilted, innovating products, innovative services, innovative models, and improving agricultural and rural financial services. Availability and accuracy can better meet the diversified and multi-level financial needs of rural revitalization. <br>
                    
                    &emsp; in order to guide local governments to play a "combination fist" of financial leverage and rural revitalization, in January this year, the People's Bank of China, the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs jointly issued "Guiding Opinions on the Revitalization of Rural Financial Services", proposing to increase rural financial supply, focusing on agricultural and rural collateral and funds. The internal credit management mechanism of financial institutions, the application and promotion of new technologies, the "three rural" green finance, etc. should be strengthened to innovate financial products and services so as to better meet the diversified financing needs of rural revitalization. <br>
                    
                    &emsp; government purchasing services refers to the part of public services directly provided by the government, which are undertaken by qualified social forces in accordance with certain procedures and paid by the government according to the contract agreement by giving full play to the role of market mechanism. Ann Xiaoning, deputy director of the Finance and Accounting Service Center of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas, believes that financial input is an important guarantee of agricultural and rural investment. The way of government purchasing services has a vane role in guiding and promoting financial capital to invest in agricultural and rural areas. It is necessary to build a pluralistic Rural Revitalization system with financial priority, inclined financial focus and active social participation. Input pattern. <br>
                    
                    &emsp; according to the disclosure, the maximum annual purchasing fund for each innovative pilot service item is 1 million yuan, which is mainly used to encourage financial institutions to reduce the cost of credit insurance for new agricultural operators, not for credit risk compensation. Each innovation pilot service item should create at least one credit product or insurance product, highlighting innovation and sustainability. Among them: the comprehensive cost of loans for credit products does not exceed 8%, the scale of individual loans does not exceed 3 million yuan, and loans should be granted to agricultural operators not less than 50 times the purchasing capital, which can be appropriately reduced in poor areas; insurance products should provide risk protection for agricultural operators not less than 20 times the purchasing capital. 。 <br></p>
