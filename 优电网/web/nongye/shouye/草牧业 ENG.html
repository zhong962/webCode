            <p style="font-size: 12px; color:gray;width: 90%;margin-left: 40px;letter-spacing: 0px;">Recently, Xi Jinping's work on agriculture, countryside and farmers was published nationwide. Agricultural and rural peasants'problems are fundamental to the national economy and people's livelihood. The strong or weak agriculture, the beautiful countryside and the rich or poor peasants determine the sense of acquisition and happiness of hundreds of millions of peasants and the quality of China's comprehensive well-off society and socialist modernization.




                    <br> Since the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping has insisted that solving the problems of agriculture, countryside and farmers should be the top priority of the Party's work. He has continuously promoted the theoretical, practical and institutional innovation of the work of agriculture, countryside and farmers, and promoted the development of agriculture and rural areas to achieve historic achievements and make historic changes. General Secretary Xi Jinping repeatedly emphasized the importance of the work of "agriculture, countryside and farmers" on many occasions. He expounded on the strategy of rural revitalization, new urbanization, national food security, poverty alleviation of the rural poor and innovative rural governance. <br> </p><h3>On the Importance of the Work of "Agriculture, Countryside and Peasants"</h3>
                <p style="letter-spacing: 0px;">★Well-off is not well-off, the key is to look at the fellow countrymen



                        <br> The key to a well-off society is the countrymen. We must see that agriculture is still the short leg of "synchronization of the four modernizations", and that the countryside is the short board of building a well-off society in an all-round way. If China wants to be strong, agriculture must be strong; if China wants to be beautiful, the countryside must be beautiful; if China wants to be rich, the peasants must be rich. Agricultural foundation is stable, rural harmony and stability, farmers live and work in peace and contentment, the overall situation is guaranteed, and all work will be more active.
                        
                        
                        
                        —— Speech at the Central Conference on Rural Work in December 2013

                        <br> At no time can we ignore agriculture, forget the peasants and neglect the countryside. We must always adhere to the policy of strengthening agriculture, benefiting farmers and enriching peasants, promote the overall well-off of the countryside, and maintain a good momentum in terms of awareness, attention and investment.

                        <br> Without agricultural and rural modernization, there will be no modernization of the whole country.
                        
                        
                        
                        <br> I have always stressed that without agricultural and rural modernization, there will be no modernization of the whole country. In the process of modernization, how to deal with the relationship between industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas, to a certain extent, determines the success or failure of modernization.

                        We should fully implement the socialist ideology with Chinese characteristics in the new era and the spirit of the Nineteenth National Congress of the Party, strengthen the Party's leadership over the work of "agriculture, countryside and farmers", insist on solving the "agriculture, countryside and farmers" issue as the top priority of the Party's work, adhere to the priority of agricultural and rural development, firmly grasp the overall tone of steady progress, implement the requirements of high-quality development, and deepen our work. Implementing the strategy of revitalizing the countryside, fulfilling the hard tasks that must be accomplished in order to build a well-off society in an all-round way, adapting to the new requirements of the domestic and foreign environmental changes for the reform and development of our countryside, unifying our thinking, strengthening our confidence and carrying out the work, and consolidating the good situation of developing agriculture and countryside.

                                <br> Implementing the strategy of rural revitalization. Agricultural and rural peasant problems are fundamental issues related to the national economy and people's livelihood. We must always take solving the "three rural" problems as the top priority of the Party's work. We should give priority to the development of agriculture and rural areas, establish and improve the system, mechanism and policy system of urban-rural integration and development, and accelerate the modernization of agriculture and rural areas in accordance with the general requirements of industrial prosperity, ecological livability, rural civilization, effective governance and affluent life.

                                We should adhere to the comprehensive revitalization of the countryside, focus on key points, make up for shortcomings, strengthen and weaknesses, realize the revitalization of rural industry, talents, culture, ecology and organization, and promote the comprehensive upgrading of agriculture, rural progress and farmers'all-round development. We should respect the wishes of the peasants, stimulate their enthusiasm, initiative and creativity, activate the endogenous motive force of rural revitalization, and let the peasants have more sense of gain, happiness and security in rural revitalization. We should persist in promoting rural revitalization through practical work, abide by the law of rural development, plan ahead, classify and advance, increase investment, work hard to promote rural revitalization and constantly achieve new results.

It reflects the overall layout of "five in one" and "four in all" strategic layout in the work of "agriculture, countryside and farmers". We should comprehensively promote rural economic construction, political construction, cultural construction, social construction, ecological civilization construction and Party building, and promote the overall upgrading of agriculture, rural progress and farmers'all-round development.

                                        <br> Food in hand, not panic in heart. There are 1.3 billion people in our country. If there is a food problem, no one can save us. Only by holding the rice bowl firmly in their hands can we maintain the overall social stability. Therefore, we must not neglect and relax agriculture because of successive harvest.

                                        Food production is based on arable land, lifeline in water conservancy, outlet in science and technology, power in policy. These key points need to be implemented one by one and put in place, and strive to achieve new breakthroughs in grain production at a high base.

                                        We should be good at looking at the essence of the food problem through phenomena. In a large country with a population of more than 1.3 billion, food shortage is a problem as well as a problem, but it is a problem of two different natures. More is inventory pressure, less is financial pressure; less is social pressure, is the pressure of the overall situation. On the issue of food, we need to look at it strategically, in a deeper and farther way.

                                        To build a well-off society in an all-round way, the most arduous and arduous task is in the countryside, especially in the poor areas. Without a well-off society in the countryside, especially in the poor areas, there will be no well-off society in an all-round way.

                                        Anti-poverty is a major event in the governance of foreign countries in ancient and modern times. Eliminating poverty, improving people's livelihood and gradually realizing common prosperity are the essential requirements of socialism and the important mission of our Party. Before the founding of the People's Republic of China, our Party led the peasants to "strike local tyrants and distribute land", in order to liberate the peasants. Now, our Party is leading the peasants to "get rid of poverty and go to a well-off society", that is, to let the peasants live a good life.

                                        <br> Food in hand, not panic in heart. There are 1.3 billion people in our country. If there is a food problem, no one can save us. Only by holding the rice bowl firmly in their hands can we maintain the overall social stability. Therefore, we must not neglect and relax agriculture because of successive harvest.

                                        <br> Food production is fundamentally in cultivated land
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        Food production is based on arable land, lifeline in water conservancy, outlet in science and technology, power in policy. These key points need to be implemented one by one and put in place, and strive to achieve new breakthroughs in grain production at a high base.

                                        <br> More food is a problem, and less food is also a problem.
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        We should be good at looking at the essence of the food problem through phenomena. In a large country with a population of more than 1.3 billion, food shortage is a problem as well as a problem, but it is a problem of two different natures. More is inventory pressure, less is financial pressure; less is social pressure, is the pressure of the overall situation. On the issue of food, we need to look at it strategically, in a deeper and farther way.

                                        Attention should be paid to resolving social contradictions in rural areas and ensuring the stability and orderliness of rural society. To improve the level of preventing and resolving social contradictions, we should start with perfecting policies, perfecting systems, fulfilling responsibilities and innovating mechanisms, timely reflect and coordinate the interests of farmers in all aspects, deal with the interests of the government and the masses, prevent and reduce social contradictions from the source, and do a good job in resolving the sources of contradictions and disputes and unexpected incidents. Urgent disposal should focus on early detection, precautions and small disposal, so as to prevent overlapping and escalation. We should learn and popularize the experience of Fengqiao, so as to achieve "small things do not go to the village, big things do not go to the town, contradictions do not hand in".

                                        <br> Tamping the Foundation of Rural Governance
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        We should consolidate the foundation of rural governance. Effective measures should be taken to strengthen the leadership role of grass-roots Party organizations in rural areas, select and strengthen Party secretaries in rural areas, rectify weak and scattered Party organizations in villages, deepen the practice of villagers'autonomy, and strengthen effective supervision of village-level power. We will improve the basic old-age insurance system for urban and rural residents, the basic medical insurance system and the major illness insurance system, the minimum living security system and the care and service system for left-behind children, women and the elderly in rural areas. We should promote the transformation of customs and customs, foster civilized local customs, good family customs and simple folk customs, improve the multi-resolution mechanism of contradictions and disputes, and carry out in-depth special struggle against gangsters and evil.
