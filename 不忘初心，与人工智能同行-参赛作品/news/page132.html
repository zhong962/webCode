        <h1 class="title">What do we need to learn if we switch to the AI industry?</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>At present, artificial intelligence has become a more and more popular direction. How ordinary programmers turn to artificial intelligence is a problem. This is an archival version of an answer to this question. Compared with the original answer, there is an increase in content.</p>

          <h3>I. purpose</h3>
          <p>The purpose of this article is to provide a simple, smooth, easy-to-implement learning method to help "ordinary" programmers step into the AI field. Here, my definition of an ordinary programmer is: a college undergraduate; busy at work; limited data available. Therefore, this article is more like an introduction to from the scratch AI.</p>
          <h3>II. Introduction to AI field</h3>
          <p>AI, also known as AI, does not just include machine learning. Symbols and logic were once thought to be the key to artificial intelligence, but now machine learning based on statistics dominates. Recently, hot and deep learning is a sub item in machine learning. It can be said that learning AI is mainly learning machine learning.</p>
          <p>However, artificial intelligence is not the same as machine learning, which must be clearly understood when entering this field. About the development history of AI, we recommend the introduction of machine learning written by Mr. Chou. The next question is: is the door of AI good? Actually, it's not very good. Let's take machine learning as an example.</p>
          <p>In the learning process, you will face a large number of complex formulas, in the actual project will face the lack of data, as well as the difficult adjustment and so on. These difficulties can easily be abandoned if they are simply because they feel that this direction is going to be "hot" in the future. Considering the characteristics of ordinary programmers, is there no way to learn such a difficult subject? The answer is No. Just make the right learning method.</p>
          <h3>III. Learning methods</h3>
          <p>The setting of learning methods is simply to answer the following questions: What am I going to learn? How am I going to learn? How am I going to learn? These three questions are summarized as: learning goals, learning principles and learning plans. The goal of learning is clear, that is, stepping into the AI field. This goal is not big, so it is easier to achieve. "Oversized goals are enough reasons for giving up in the future."</p>
          <p>The learning policy can be summed up as "interest first, practice learning combination". To put it simply is to cultivate interest first, then learn to interspersed practice with spiral. This way of learning is good, and it is not easy for people to give up. After learning policy, we can draw up a learning plan, also known as the learning route. The following is the introduction of learning routes.</p>
          <h3>IV. Learning route</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1312.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>This learning route is designed as follows: first understand the field, establish a comprehensive vision, develop sufficient interest, and then begin to learn the basis of machine learning, here choose a shallow to deep course to learn, the course had better have enough experiments to be able to carry out war. After the foundation has been laid, the machine learning has been fully understood, machine learning can be used to solve a practical problem.</p>
          <p>At this point, machine learning can still be treated as a black box. After the accumulation of actual experience, we can consider continuing learning. There are two choices at this time, deep learning or continuing machine learning. Deep learning is currently the hottest machine learning direction, some of which have been different from traditional machine learning, so it can be learned independently. Besides deep learning, machine learning also includes practical methods such as statistical learning, ensemble learning and so on.</p>
          <p>If conditions are enough, both of them can learn both at the same time. Some laws are common to both. After learning, you already have a strong knowledge reserve, can enter the more difficult actual combat. There are two choices at this point: the industry can choose to look at open source projects and read code for code modification purposes; the academic community can look at papers in specific fields and want to publish papers to solve problems.</p>
          <p>Either way, you need to be knowledgeable and have a strong coding ability, so you can inspect and exercise well. After this stage, it can be said that we have stepped into the field of AI. "The master leads the door and practices in the individual". After that, we have to go by ourselves.</p>
          <h3>V. Summary</h3>
          <p>The purpose of this article is to help students who don't know much about the AI field, but want to get into the door. I'm just going to step in, because it's really hard to master this field, and it takes years of accumulation and effort. It is very important to fully understand your own characteristics and formulate appropriate learning methods before conducting domain learning.</p>
          <p>First of all, we must have a thorough understanding of this field and cultivate interest. In learning, keep a gradual learning policy, do not aggressively study difficult resources; combined with learning and practice complementary strategies, do not read only see, the actual sense of accomplishment. Learn a resource for a full purpose, not to learn open source projects and look at code, but to write open source projects; not to write papers for publishing, but to do things.</p>
          <p>If a learning resource is difficult for you, it doesn't necessarily mean it's your problem. It may be the problem of the speaker or the writer of the learning resource. Simple people who can talk difficult problems are those who have real standards. Therefore, we must learn high-quality resources, rather than indiscriminate learning. Finally, remember to learn with interest. Learning takes a long time and the process is difficult, and only interest is the best help for you to persevere and overcome difficulties.</p>
