        <h1 class="title">Artificial intelligence "plunge into" intelligence circles</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Intelligence work is far more complicated and complicated than we think. No, the US intelligence department began to replace artificial with AI algorithm.</p>
          <p>It is reported that the U. S. Department of Defense is now stepping up research and development of intelligence technology to assist intelligence personnel to gather intelligence information, and plans to use artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze and collate intelligence data of extremist terrorist organizations. Coincidentally, the CIA is also developing AI for acquiring social media data. In the report "Artificial Intelligence and National Security" issued by the U. S. Security Center, the importance of artificial intelligence technology to intelligence collection and analysis is elaborated.</p>
          <p>Artificial intelligence "joins" the intelligence community, can fully integrate the satellite, Internet, UAV and other technical means, speed up the speed of intelligence extraction and analysis, realize all-weather, multi-level, real-time and extensive intelligence collection, and may even become the "big cafe" of the intelligence community.</p>
          <h3>Testing the "eye of the air" -- the intelligence community urgently needs "artificial intelligence spy".</h3>
          <p>In recent years, thanks to the upgrading of information technology and the acceleration of the trend of network convergence, invisible data presents a "blowout" situation. Especially with the development of new technologies such as UAV and satellite imagery, a large number of images and video information are continuously transmitted. This can "hurt" intelligence analysts. Comparing with the past information collection methods, such as mail, handwritten documents, telephone recordings and so on, the "mass" data is born every minute and every second in today's social network. How to extract the key information quickly and effectively has become the focus of intelligence research.</p>
          <p>The reason why the intelligence community urgently needs "artificial intelligence agents" is that the intelligence data acquired today are becoming more and more complex, beyond the ability of human analysts to perform intelligence analysis tasks. The CIA has previously disclosed that it will rely on Silicon Valley developers to carry out 137 AI processing projects. These programs also cover a wide range of topics, ranging from predicting the likelihood of future major events by comparing data changes to letting computers automatically mark people or objects that attract the attention of intelligence analysts. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence projects, people have the ability to collect data from social media, and the seemingly inadvertent "circle of friends" may have long been spotted by "artificial intelligence spies".</p>
          <p>At the same time, the U. S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency also actively "test water" artificial intelligence, through a series of research projects to seek artificial intelligence in the field of intelligence breakthroughs. Not long ago, the U.S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency held a special in-depth learning challenge to recruit artificial intelligence "agents" who can automatically parse satellite images.</p>
          <p>It is well known that military spy satellites, like the "space paparazzi" general, every day around the earth crazy photographs. Intelligence analysts are indeed limited in their ability to process images, and intelligence gathering for military installations such as missile silos is best left to artificial intelligence. It is reported that the existing artificial intelligence technology has achieved 75% workload automation.</p>
          <p>In fact, the cia created the digital innovation bureau as early as 2015.The artificial intelligence system they developed to predict social unrest can provide early warning and has been used in violence against police in us states.At the end of 2017, the us military launched an ai intelligence analysis test in the Middle East.Computers loaded with special algorithms are used to help analyse video information collected by uavs, automatically identifying people, cars and buildings.Through continuous learning and algorithm update, the automatic recognition rate of artificial intelligence in complex environment has exceeded 80%.Next, the U.S. military will test the aerial eye on more drone platforms.</p>
          <h3>Set up the "algorithm bridge" -- "swim across the algorithm" in massive data.</h3>
          <p>Data everywhere, the key to see you "use your heart". Previously, a "good news" through the flight track record software to identify 100 aircraft from the U. S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Through these flight data to build models, and then with the aid of artificial intelligence algorithm and other aircraft flight records for continuous data analysis, they also found a lot of "snow" special aircraft and even military aircraft.</p>
          <p>So human behavior itself is data, and artificial intelligence is just an algorithmic model for using data. With so much data to sift through, intelligence agencies are pinning their hopes on artificial intelligence, trying to use it to process billions of bits of data quickly. It can be said that artificial intelligence has built an "algorithm bridge" between available resources and urgent needs, with the aid of algorithms in massive data "swimming", so that the degree of intelligence analysis automation has been greatly improved. Instead of spending a lot of time finding out where the tank is, people can spend more time thinking about why the tank is there and what the tank will do next.</p>
          <p>AI is not involved in intelligence work. With the help of speech recognition, text recognition, face recognition and other technologies, people can "integrate and annotate" a large number of unstructured data, and convert the collected data into useful information that can be easily understood by the computer. It is reported that the US air force is studying the use of machine vision recognition system to monitor content in video. Ideally, AI is not a mechanical alert to specific keywords or images, but a holistic, dynamic understanding of all text, images and video information.</p>
          <p>Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg of AI for intelligence. With the help of artificial intelligence technology, researchers can realize the association integration of discrete data, which not only improves the level of intelligence automatic processing, but also can learn the open source intelligence data based on user identification independently. The U.S. military is spending billions of dollars to build Geospatial Intelligence systems that automate data collection and processing through artificial intelligence and machine learning involving "human geography" Web pages, e-mail, instant messaging, and social media. The advantage of artificial intelligence "intelligence analyst" is that the algorithm can adapt to the changing environment and scene, and can also replace the human operator to implement the task of target recognition.</p>
          <h3>Advancing into the "invisible battlefield" -- increasingly becoming the forefront of military contest</h3>
          <p>The organic integration of artificial intelligence and intelligence shows that scientific and technological progress is pushing forward the technological change and innovation in the process of information acquisition, collation and analysis. It is the huge "data black hole" in the field of intelligence threats that human beings are facing, and constantly promote the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning and other technologies in the field of Defense Science and technology. Today, artificial intelligence has long been the forefront of military battles, like human thinking of artificial intelligence "big cafe", but is a leader in many applications.</p>
          <p>As early as December 2015, along with the "third offset strategy" put forward, the U. S. Department of Defense has proposed five key technologies around intelligence and autonomy, further promoting the rapid development of military applications in the field of artificial intelligence. In 2016, the United States issued two special reports, Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence and National Strategic Plan for Research and Development of Artificial Intelligence. In fact, artificial intelligence has been placed at the core of science and technology strategy to maintain its status as a global military power. In the report "Artificial Intelligence and National Security" with the participation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency of American Intelligence, the urgent need for the development of artificial intelligence in the field of intelligence analysis is put forward more clearly. Today, the U.S. military has planned to use artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze and collate large amounts of intelligence data from extremist organizations. The first "algorithm weapon" of the U.S. Defense Department's "Algorithmic Warfare Interfunctional Team" is also an artificial intelligence algorithm for UAV target detection, classification and early warning. AI has long been "running to" the "invisible battlefield" of intelligence.</p>
          <p>Artificial intelligence for intelligence analysis will not completely "lay off" human beings. In the satellite image analysis contest launched by the US Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency, there are many problems, such as the upside-down of multi-angle object images, the influence of cloud movement on imaging effect, and the uneven resolution of satellite images, which further increase the difficulty of deep learning of artificial intelligence. Moreover, the earth satellite image is not perfect, even if the accuracy of artificial intelligence recognition reaches more than 90%, still can not complete all the work independently.</p>
          <p>In addition, the biggest "artifice" of AI is derived from human deception or "induced input". We only need simple data input to "cheat" AI system. Even if the pixels were misplaced, a picture of a tank could be mistaken for a car, but the human eye could easily tell the difference. For this reason, people are looking for ways to prevent and deal with deception for AI. It seems that the military game of intrigues has shifted from traditional battlefield to digital field.</p>
