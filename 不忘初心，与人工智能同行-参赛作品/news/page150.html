        <h1 class="title">What does AI mean in manufacturing?</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Accenture, a consultancy, recently released the report on Artificial Intelligence: helping China's economic growth. The report examines the impact of artificial intelligence on China's economy, pointing out that by 2035, China's annual economic growth rate will increase from 6.3% to 7.9% driven by artificial intelligence.</p>
          <p>As the "factory of the world" nowadays, the transformation of China's manufacturing industry is of great importance to the country's future. The timely launch of national strategies such as Intelligent Manufacturing Development Plan and Intelligent Manufacturing 2025 has provided direction and framework for the whole country and industry. At the same time, enterprises in various manufacturing industries are also actively taking action. More and more enterprises begin to explore the application of new technologies such as big data and intelligent robots in the manufacturing field. To explore the road of intelligent upgrading of manufacturing industry. In this process, how the manufacturing industry can effectively use the accumulated resources and new technology experience of the Internet to accelerate the process of intelligent transformation has become the focus of our concern.</p>
          <p>Since its inception, Gaia Workshop has focused on labor management, focusing on the impact of automation and artificial intelligence on labor management and change. To bring new ideas to labor management in all walks of life, today we share this article from Tencent Research Institute.</p>
          <h2>Realistic problems faced by China's manufacturing industry</h2>
          <p>Although in terms of volume, China's manufacturing industry has ranked first in the world since 2010, replacing the U.S. for more than 100 years, but in terms of structure, China's manufacturing industry is in the middle and low end of the global manufacturing value chain, as a "world processing plant" to earn low profit margin "hard money".</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1491.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>With the change of the international situation after the financial crisis in 2008, all countries are trying to regain the competitiveness of manufacturing industry. China's manufacturing industry in a large number of low-middle regions is naturally attacked by other countries from all sides: the low-end direction, South Pacific, India, Mexico and other high-population low-cost markets for manufacturing enterprises increasingly fierce competition. In the high-end direction, the return of manufacturing industry in developed countries such as Europe and the United States has been contained. More and more companies are moving factories away from China, or at least reducing production in China.</p>
          <p>It is impossible for China today to take the initiative to "downgrade" to pool resources and manpower costs with other developing countries. The future of China's manufacturing industry, mainly to high-end manufacturing, that is, to high-precision, high-quality, high-value chain direction upgrade. However, three main avenues for high-end manufacturing have been taken by pioneers: Germany with precision machine capabilities at its core, Japan with efficient personnel and organizational capabilities at its core, and the United States with science and data capabilities at its core. At present, there are three deficiencies in China. The training of ability requires time and pressure.</p>
          <p>With the opening of a new round of competition for hegemony in the manufacturing industry, the major competitors are spare no effort to build and promote new framework system standards in order to lead the transformation of manufacturing industry. Among them, the most industrial enterprises in China should be the industrial 4 in Germany and the industrial Internet in the United States. The two frameworks themselves are not too big a problem, and even have established a mapping docking relationship, which has played a positive role in global universality. The key problem lies in the practice of enterprises under the guidance of these two frameworks. At present, there is no real universal open platform, and there are still barriers to competition among manufacturers, which makes the equipment interconnection between manufacturers difficult.</p>
          <p>When manufacturing enterprises face manufacturers, choosing a manufacturer may mean being locked into the integrated solution of the manufacturer, with high value-added services and replacement costs, and difficult to master the real core technology. For this reason, China's manufacturing industry needs to establish an independent intelligent manufacturing framework standard system, and encourage industries and enterprises to independently research and develop, explore their own intelligent experience, and eventually converge into their own leading intelligent manufacturing platform and ecology, complete the transformation and upgrading of the entire manufacturing industry.</p>
          <h2>How to enhance China's intelligent manufacturing upgrading by Internet companies</h2>
          <p>For China's manufacturing industry, there is still a lack of automation process and process level, while the Internet of Things, cloud, large data and artificial intelligence and other new technology outbreaks of historical nodes, embracing the new technology on behalf of the Internet, take the road of integration of the two is the best way to catch up with the advanced manufacturing countries in the curve. It is irresponsible to say that the Internet does not understand manufacturing or manufacturing. What we should really care about is how to make good use of the experience of Internet companies in the consumer market to help the manufacturing industry upgrade.</p>
          <h3>Do both ends service: provide front-end needs insight and back-end marketing services.</h3>
          <p>In terms of consumer demand, with the help of consumer behavior of its own business, and with the help of a broad range of Internet information collection tools (such as social media listening), it is possible to draw a more complete picture of users and help manufacturing enterprises to analyze and judge product trends; in terms of marketing services, online marketing channels and channels Instant marketing can also help manufacturers rapidly promote products and services.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1492.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>At present, this part of the content has been very rich, large-scale e-commerce platform, third-party large data analysis tools are providing related services. The central question to consider in the future is whether these D (Data) will be more efficient for manufacturers or more efficient for middleware, assuming that D2M is an inevitable trend in the future. From the perspective of the value of large data, the more dimensions and volume of large data, the higher the theoretical value content.</p>
          <p>Therefore, whether it is the Internet or manufacturing enterprises in the future, it is essential to build such a cross-enterprise, cross-product consumer insight platform. The current platform can only outline a more comprehensive, or one-dimensional needs; the future platform should be based on the characteristics of products in different industries, positioning and outlining different portraits to guide the production of different products.</p>
          <h3>Providing infrastructure: assisting manufacturing companies to calculate Xiang Yun migration</h3>
          <p>Cloud computing is the infrastructure of the development of the Internet, and has become the core competence of some Internet enterprises. At present, the new IT infrastructure has been basically located. To catch up with the developed countries, it is necessary for China's manufacturing industry to transfer the whole enterprise process to the cloud as soon as possible. Through cloud deployment, it can effectively reduce costs and facilitate the integration of IT and OT. There are two ways to do this: Internet enterprise-led, universal cloud computing infrastructure; industrial equipment and software enterprise-led, professional cloud computing infrastructure (industrial cloud, etc.). For Internet companies, the lack of experience in industry and manufacturing is a short board that can hardly be compensated in the short term.</p>
          <p>Therefore, it may be a more reasonable way in the near future to do a good job of general IaaS, to play their IT computing experience and expertise to provide services for other professional clouds. In the long run, the core of IaaS's industrial cloud PaaS is the ultimate effort to build. And it involves all kinds of hardware and software interface and data standardization. Internet enterprises should work with high-quality industrial equipment and software enterprises to formulate relevant norms and standards together with national government departments as soon as possible to promote the successful establishment and application of large industrial cloud platform infrastructure.</p>
          <h3>Contributing to technology enabling: giving full play to the advantages of AI technology</h3>
          <p>The rise of AI technology provides a possibility for China's manufacturing industry to overtake corners. At present, the manufacturing technology of advanced manufacturing countries, such as Europe and the United States, is mainly based on the development of information processing technology of the previous generation, that is, the way of information transmission takes text as the core. This is not a big problem in machine-to-machine interaction, but it is limited in human-to-machine interaction. A lot of human experience can only be transmitted through text (such as parameter input), which is not in line with human visual and other sensory experience.</p>
          <p>With the development of artificial intelligence, machine recognition and interaction of voice, image and video become more and more realistic, which creates opportunities for the overthrow of the entire manufacturing process, at least the information transmission process. Imagine how many people would save the cost of repeated measurements, such as calipers, if the machine could find the problem and location of defective products directly through video recognition and display them directly by overlapping images.</p>
          <p>There are more and more IT giants offering AI APIs or SDKs in their cloud to facilitate other enterprises to invoke and redevelop. For Internet companies, providing similar capabilities is also an inevitable choice. However, there is still a huge gap between general AI capabilities and dedicated AI applications, which requires joint research and development with manufacturing enterprises in order to give full play to AI capabilities more effectively.</p>
          <h3>Hatching new manufacturing: incubating new manufacturing enterprises with capital and technology</h3>
          <p>The new industrial revolution requires investment, and may well be far greater than the information revolution in investment (physical assets, labor costs, etc. are relatively large), and investment is the most scarce thing in manufacturing. There are two aspects of this investment:</p>
          <p>Firstly, the profit margin of China's manufacturing industry has been declining for many years, which makes the pursuit of profit-maximizing capital not too cold to the manufacturing sector; secondly, the vigorous development of the Internet has absorbed a large number of outstanding talents, talent determines the ability of technological innovation, the transformation of manufacturing industry is lack of a large number of high-quality cross-border talent injection. . From this perspective, Internet investment in manufacturing is necessary and necessary. There is a lot of room for the Internet to invest in the manufacturing industry. We can start from new intelligent products (such as AI speakers), set up project teams or invest in start-ups, invest in capital, personnel and artificial intelligence and other technological capabilities. From the new angle of intelligent production, we can go deep into and construct new manufacturing processes, and in the process. Attempt to develop software tools and ultimately form models and experiences of new manufacturing enterprises. Google's homemade hardware, Facebook's Area 404 hardware lab, and so on, all initially show this clue.</p>
