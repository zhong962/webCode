          <p>Yoshua Bengio, a respected consultant for Maluuba and a pioneer in in-depth learning, also took over from Microsoft as an AI research consultant. Recently, Bengio, as head of the Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms, visited Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Washington, and held talks with employees. This is the record of this forum.</p>

          <h3>On unsupervised learning</h3>
          <p>[Q] Let's start. When people ask you what AI is, how do you answer it?</p>
          <p>[Yoshua Bengio] Artificial intelligence is the creation of "smart" machines that can do what humans can do. To do this, it needs to understand the world and use that knowledge to do something useful.</p>
          <p>[Q] But it's kind of like kicking a can into the street because intelligence doesn't have a uniform definition, but as you describe it, it can accomplish complex tasks. So do you think it has to react to its surroundings or something like that?</p>
          <p>[Yoshua Bengio] not necessarily. You can imagine having a very smart search engine that understands all sorts of things, but it doesn't necessarily have real shape, nor does it live in an environment where there is only human-computer interaction. So, what we know about intelligence is as if every time we think about animals we automatically associate certain actions and behaviors. However, intelligence can be different in form or in different ways. So a mouse is very smart in its environment. If you or I go into a mouse's head and try to control its muscles and survive, we may not live long. If you understand what I mean, you can learn a lot in some areas and be very smart in some areas, but you may know little about another area and not so smart in others.</p>
          <p>[Q] How do you describe the current level of technology development? Where can we apply artificial intelligence?</p>
          <p>[Yoshua Bengio] We have made tremendous progress in computer perception, understanding of images and sounds, and even in verbal expression. But we are far from inventing automatic perception machines, and far from creating robots that understand the higher concepts of our discourse. So there are still many things to do.</p>
          <p>[Q] Do you use this example to make an analogy? Or do you think we can learn something from the way children acquire knowledge? Is this knowledge very helpful for establishing a system that can conduct unsupervised learning?</p>
          <p>[Yoshua Bengio] Both. We can think of this as an obvious analogy, and we can generalize in other cases. But the same fact is that, at least in the field of artificial intelligence science, some experts study the way children learn to study human behavior and how our brains work. In other words, we get inspiration from the form of wisdom that we know. We can not fully understand it, but we know its existence, we can observe it, and I study it. Of course, scientists in biology and psychology have been studying for decades.</p>
          <p>[Q] Have we learned everything from the brain that can help us build intelligent computers? Or they really have nothing in common. They are very different systems.\</p>
          <p>[Yoshua Bengio] Today, the deep learning field that has been successfully developed is just a modern neural network. Since 50s, neural networks have been in existence for decades. Of course, their inspiration comes from our understanding of the brain. Now that we know more, in fact, some elements of brain computing have recently been introduced into neural networks. As in 2011, we introduced corrective devices into the Deep Neural Network and demonstrated that they help to better train deeper networks. In fact, its inspiration comes from the computation of the nonlinear problems existing in the neurons of the brain. So we continue to view the brain as a potential source of inspiration. Having said that, we still do not understand the brain. Biologists and neuroscientists have done a lot of observation, but they still don't fully understand how the brain works, and most importantly, for me, don't know how the brain learns, which is what we need to import into the machine learning system.</p>
          <p>[Q] Another highly speculative question for me is, do you think we're going to build conscious machines? Can we do that? In your mind, is consciousness -- the ability to perceive and self-consciousness, and all consciousness associated with consciousness -- necessary to build a general intelligence? Or is it totally irrelevant?</p>
          <p>[Yoshua Bengio] Well, it depends on what kind of artificial intelligence we want to build. So, I think you can easily have some form of wisdom without being conscious of it. As I mentioned, a very intelligent encyclopedia can answer any question you ask, but it doesn't have any sense of self. But if we want to make things like robots, we may need to give them some self-awareness. For example, a robot needs to know where it is and how it compares to other objects or agents. For example, if it is damaged, it needs to know how to avoid being damaged. It will have some primitive feeling, some way of knowing that it has reached its goal, and you can think of it as being happy or something else. So the components of consciousness already exist in the systems we are building, but only in very primitive forms. So consciousness is not a very definite thing, it is not even recognized by people, not thinking about what intelligence and consciousness are. But what I understand about it is that we're going to build a machine that has more and more ideology, and that's what we're building.</p>
          <h3>The impact of AI on Employment</h3>
          <p>[Q] So, in the field of artificial intelligence, there are quite a lot of worries and fears. Especially about work and automation, what do you think will happen in the near future?</p>
          <p>[Yoshua Bengio] The job market is likely to undergo a difficult transformation. According to some studies, about half of the work will be seriously affected. This means that a large number of jobs will disappear. Some jobs may not necessarily require actual people, but their job responsibilities may change because they do a lot of things that are repetitive and can be done by computers, so we need fewer people to do the same thing. At the same time, I also believe that this will eventually create new jobs that will not create a pattern of total unemployment, because there are still jobs that do not want to be handed over to computers. I don't want my children to be taken care of by machines. I want someone to interact with my children and with my parents. So, for all the care and teaching jobs, to a certain extent, although computers will play an important role, I think we still want teachers to teach, not machines. Now, we can't, the cost is too expensive. But once automated jobs are automated, I think those who do repetitive work will lose their jobs. And all the creative people, who don't have that much repetitive work to do (and won't be replaced), and of course artists, scientists, are areas where we want more people to work.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I think it will be a change and many people will lose their jobs because they will not be trained to do other jobs. So we have to build the right social network security to take care of these people, maybe to provide a minimum living allowance or something, but we have to think seriously about this change because it could have a huge political impact. Think of the transformation of the industrial revolution, from agriculture to industry to all the human suffering that took place between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries... Many things could have been avoided if we had taken the social measures that were eventually established in the Second World War. So, similarly, we need to think about what is the right way to deal with this change. Of course there will be enough money to support these changes, because AI will create a lot of wealth and many new services will be more efficient, so in a sense, we will all be richer globally. But the question is, where will the money go? We must ensure that some of them can help us change from a human perspective.</p>
          <p>[Q] When I talked about this topic, the first question I was asked was, "What should my children learn so that they can be employed in fifty years (without losing their jobs)?" The answer may be, "do something that requires emotional involvement and creativity." Is there any other type of work that can be changed into such kind?</p>
          <p>[Yoshua Bengio] Obviously, these computers have to be built by some people, so we need scientists, programmers, and so on. This situation will continue for some time. But this is only a small part of the population. I think we'll need more people who can do science, engineering, and computer related work, and that won't change in the short term. As you said, I think the work of communication between people will also need more. Basically, we will have more extra wealth and some people will have extra wealth. Maybe you work for a company like Google, and you get a good salary, and now you can use the money to send your children to a school where there are only five children in a class, not thirty.</p>
          <h3>The combination of robots and AI</h3>
          <p>[Q] Generally speaking, there is also a discussion about robots in comparison with artificial intelligence. Mind and body can be replaced by technology. But the development of robots seems to be much slower. I mean, if there is Moore's law, they can double in more than two years. Do you have any idea about the combination of robots and artificial intelligence? Do robots need artificial intelligence? Do we need artificial intelligence to learn? Or just the relationship between apples and oranges. They have nothing to do with each other?</p>
          <p>[Yoshua Bengio] Of course, there are many links between them. I believe you can have wisdom without your body. But I also believe that having a body, or something like that, as I'll explain later, may be an important factor in achieving this intelligence. So, I think we can learn a lot by interacting with the world. I think the idea of robot interaction with the environment is very important. Now, the robot itself has legs and arms, and I hope it will progress more slowly than virtual intelligence. Because the robot's research cycle is slow, it requires constant testing to build it and program it. More importantly, robots need time to interact, and a robot can only learn so much. But if you have a robot, in other words, it's an intelligent vehicle that can interact with people, and it can interact with millions or even billions of people. So it can have interactions, but they're not physical interactions, they're virtual interactions, and you can learn from a lot of data, just like everything on the Web. So I bet we'll see the progress of artificial intelligence in virtual robots, not real physical robots. But in the end, I think we will also achieve a breakthrough in physical robotics, but the speed will be different.</p>
          <h3>Machine Translation and creativity</h3>
          <p>[Q] A domain that you are very interested in is Natural Language Processing. Whenever I call my airline, I have to name my 8 member. If I wear headphones, I will see mistakes in recognition. So, I always have to pull out my head device and face it. However, in other programs, such as Amazon's Allxa or Google's assistants, and all of this, it seems to be able to understand complete paragraphs and sentences and capture the correct interpretation. So what have I experienced in these two totally different experiences? Because there is no context in the first case, it really doesn't know how to guess the relationship between 8 and H and A.</p>
          <p>[Yoshua Bengio] So the system is not very smart, and some systems are not smart at all. Machine learning methods are used only in deployed systems, and they are still used only in some parts of the system. By the way, the same is true for today's autopilot cars. The system is more or less hand-designed, but some functions, such as pedestrian recognition, or language recognition, identify the person you are talking about by name only; these functions are performed by independent training modules trained in supervised learning. This is the present situation. From the point of view of language understanding, the current state of technology allows these systems to better understand what you're talking about, even what you're talking about. However, they are still not good at making rational judgments and reasoning that we think. So, things like machine translation, to some extent, have made great progress, partly because of what we do in the lab, you can get the computer to understand the meaning of a sentence and use it, and these details can be used as a standard to define good translation. However, in the case of complex semantic fuzziness, you may still make mistakes. So there are other things that machines are not very good at, including high-level understanding and analogy.;这些功能是由受监督学习训练的独立培训的模块完成的。这就是现在的情况。从语言理解的角度来说，目前的这种科技发展状态让这些系统能够很好地理解你所谈论的话题，甚至是你所说的内容。但是，他们仍然不擅长做出我们所认为的理性判断和推理。所以，像机器翻译这样的东西，在某种程度上已经取得了很大的进步，部分原因是我们在实验室里做的事情，你可以让电脑理解句子的意思，并且使用，这些细节可以作为一个定义好翻译的标准。但是，在有复杂语义模糊的情况下，你仍然可能会出错。所以，还有一些机器不太擅长的事情，包括高层次的理解和类比。</p>
          <p>[Q] You mentioned that you are very optimistic about the work that requires human creativity. I have been amazed at the number of AI researchers, who disdain creativity. They don't think of anything special or interesting. They think computers can be more creative than other ordinary things. What do you think of human creativity?</p>
          <p>[Yoshua Bengio] Actually, I have been studying creativity, and we have different names for it. In my field, we call it the generative model. So we have a neural network that can generate images, which is the most we do. But now we're also doing sound and voice generation, and if we can see enough examples of such objects, we might be able to synthesize any kind of object. So the computer can look at a sample of the natural image and create new images that look very realistic. Obviously, though, you can see that they are not real, but you can see clearly what objects are. So we've made great progress in the ability of computers to imagine synthesizing images, sounds, or sentences. So, in a sense, the computer is creative, it can create new poetry, or new music. The only problem is, from a human point of view, its creation is not so great. In this sense, it's not original, nor surprising, it's still not as good as humans can do. So, while computers can be very creative, and we have a lot of research that allows them to produce all sorts of new things that seem reasonable, we are far from being able to do that. So, like the core issue I started with, computers don't have common sense, they don't have enough understanding of how the world works. Without this common sense, without a high-level understanding of the causal relationship between interpretation and causation, it is still missing. Before that, human creativity will be far greater than machines.</p>
