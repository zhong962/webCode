          <p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence have been the talk of the city for the past few years, and their pace will never slow down compared to any other time. It is believed that 2019 will be a year for companies waiting to eventually join the gold industry to witness its growth. So what might we see next year? New uses and innovative uses of machine learning? The further development of human computer interaction? The rise of AI aides? Let's look into the prediction of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the coming months.</p>
          <h3>New uses of cross industry machine learning</h3>
          <p>When dealing with the same advanced technology as machine learning, no industry will benefit at all. I mean, how can companies make use of technologies that can make them more successful? Over the next year, machine learning in all of these industries will have many new uses, and I'm not just talking about marketing and sales.</p>
          <p>The US Army is currently using machine learning to predict when combat vehicles need to be repaired. Think about it, our army uses millions of equipment every day. In order to track the data involved, they are recruiting help from AI assistants. For the first time, dozens of armored infantry transport will receive sensors in the vehicle engine. These sensors will record the temperature and RPM and transmit it to the software. The machine learning function will look for matching data patterns similar to engine failures in vehicles.</p>
          <p>What if your car does this?If your car can tell you that the transmission is about to be scrapped, the AAA may be obsolete.If the military is using this technology, I'm sure it won't be long before we see it in the civilian world.</p>
          <p>The automotive industry is not the only industry to see potential new uses for this technology, and health care will see some changes. As if Google hadn't yet appeared on the AI map, they'd already begun using machine learning to predict the likelihood of death in patients -- an astonishing 95 percent accuracy rate. What about? The AI created by the company looks at the variables of patients' health records, taking into account demographic statistics, health history and so on. It then predicts the probability of death within 24 hours after admission. When you hear it for the first time, it sounds sick, but think about the impact it might have on the health care industry. Machine learning can help save lives! It sounds cool.</p>
          <p>Finally, a research group recently used machine learning to predict stock market performance based on public earnings documents. These documents are combined with the stock price data before and after the market announcement. The model tries to find out the relationship between language content and stock price. After testing, the most successful result is a 62% chance to predict low performing stocks. It's not the highest percentage, but when you invest in something as risky as the stock market, I'll take the opportunity with 62% accuracy.</p>
          <p>As you can see, AI and machine learning enable us to predict the future by using the past. In terms of artificial intelligence and machine learning prediction, I believe we will learn more about companies that have discovered how to use these technologies to read and interpret data.</p>
          <h3>Further development of human computer interaction</h3>
          <p>Artificial intelligence is just a programming robot to perform trivial tasks. In fact, enterprises begin to regard AI as an extension of their business and contribute to its success. More and more companies are working to strengthen the relationship between machines and human beings. We are designing AI to achieve this goal.</p>
          <p>Companies that are developing artificial intelligence are trying to make it understand the nuances of human interaction. When we talk, we speak more than we think. Can you imagine a chatting robot able to recognize what you say in your words? This is great for customer service.</p>
          <p>Artificial intelligence is expected to continue to develop throughout 2019. Having said that, I think we will also begin to understand the limitations of artificial intelligence and where human intervention lies. It will be interesting to see where we can find balance and success.</p>
          <h3>The rise of AI assistant</h3>
          <p>Do you often turn to AI assistant? In the car seat, you've usually asked Alexa to turn on the lights and play music on Pandora, asking Siri how much traffic he looks like on his way home. And these simple tasks are just the beginning. We will start using these assistants every day for tasks such as searching the Internet, reading emails, answering communications, and even paying bills and ordering products.</p>
          <p>2019 will be the first year of the development of AI assistants, showing us the strength and practicality of these tools. They can do more than you think.</p>
