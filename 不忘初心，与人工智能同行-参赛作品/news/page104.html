          <p>Bird strike has always been one of the most important factors threatening aviation safety, whether it crashes aircraft or causes engine failure. What measures can be taken to effectively curb this situation? Recently, a research team at California Institute of Technology (California Institute of Technology) skillfully used algorithms to allow fully automatic UAVs to fly in specific trajectories and successfully drive out birds.</p>
          <p>Because airports are mostly located in the suburbs, it is easy to attract the "attention" of bird friends, or even occasionally "door-to-door" and lead to bird attacks. One of the best-known was the 2009 NASA Flight 1549 crash, when the plane was hit by a Canadian goose during takeoff and climbing, resulting in the simultaneous shutdown of two engines, complete loss of power, and eventually forced to land on the Hudson River.</p>
          <p>In order to prevent birds from attacking, most of them are driven by remote control aircraft or birds of prey. But whether it's a professional operator or a raptor trainer, there's a certain amount of extra cost, and the results are not good, so is there a better way?</p>
          <p>"I don't think I'll be so lucky next time," says Soon-Jo Chung, a researcher at the California Institute of Technology in the light of the aforementioned incidents, according to TechCrunch, and he wants to use technology to defend against bird attacks in combination with his expertise in automation and robotics.</p>
          <p>The team studied how animal populations move and interact, and created models of how birds move when threatened, using them on UAVs. Using this mechanism, birds will automatically follow the UAV to prevent birds from entering specific protected areas, as shown in the video.</p>
          <p>This method will not hurt the birds, but also can effectively complete the task, the future team will carry out more experiments to adjust the model, so that the system to a reliable state, no matter what size of birds, flight speed can be coped with.</p>
