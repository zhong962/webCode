        <h1 class="title">Ten facts you need to know about machine learning</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>As a person who often explains machine learning to non-professionals, I've organized the following ten points as explanations for machine learning.</p>
          <h3>1. machine learning means learning from data, and AI is a fashionable word.</h3>
          <p>Machine learning is not like the hype: you can solve myriad problems by providing the right training data to the right learning algorithm. Call it AI, if it helps to sell your AI system. But you know, AI is just a fashionable word, which represents people's expectations of it.</p>
          <h3>2. machine learning mainly involves data and algorithms, but the most important is data.</h3>
          <p>Machine learning algorithm, especially the progress of deep learning, has many exciting points. But data is the key factor that makes machine learning possible. Machine learning can not have complex algorithm, but it can not do without good data.</p>
          <h3>3. unless you have a lot of data, you should stick to a simple model.</h3>
          <p>Machine learning trains models according to patterns in data and explores the space of possible models defined by parameters. If the parameter space is too large, it will over-fit the training data and train a model that can not generalize itself. More mathematical calculations are needed to explain this in detail, and you should use this as a guideline to make your model as simple as possible.</p>
          <h3>4. the quality of machine learning is strongly related to the quality of data used in training.</h3>
          <p>As the saying goes, "When you input a pile of garbage into a computer, the output must be a pile of garbage data." Although this sentence appeared earlier than machine learning, but this is precisely the key limitation of machine learning. Machine learning can only find patterns existing in training data. For supervised machine learning tasks (such as classification), you need a robust, well-marked, rich training set.</p>
          <h3>5. machine learning plays a role only when the training data are representative.</h3>
          <p>As the fund prospectus warns, "past performance does not guarantee future results". Machine learning should also issue a similar warning stating that it can only work based on data that is the same distribution as the training data. Therefore, it is necessary to be aware of the deviation between training data and production data, and to repeat the training model regularly so as to ensure that it will not become obsolete.</p>
          <h3>6. most of the work in machine learning is data transformation.</h3>
          <p>With all the hype about machine learning, you might think that machine learning is mainly about choosing and tuning algorithms. But the reality is plain: most of your time and effort is spent on data cleansing and feature engineering, which translates the original features into features that better represent the data signal.</p>
          <h3>7. deep learning is a revolutionary progress, but it is not a panacea.</h3>
          <p>As machine learning has been applied and developed in many fields, in-depth learning has also been widely publicized. In addition, in-depth learning facilitates the automation of some work traditionally done through feature engineering, especially for images and video data. But deep learning is not a panacea. Without ready to use, you still need to put in a lot of energy to clean up and transform data.</p>
          <h3>8. machine learning systems are susceptible to operator errors.</h3>
          <p>Apologize to NRA, "machine learning algorithm does not kill, it is human killing." When machine learning system fails, it is seldom because of machine learning algorithm. It is more likely that human errors are introduced into the training data, resulting in deviations or other systematic errors. We should always be skeptical and adopt a software engineering approach to machine learning.</p>
          <h3>9. machine learning may create a self fulfilling prophecy by accident.</h3>
          <p>In many applications of machine learning, the decisions you make today will affect the training data collected tomorrow. Once the machine learning system incorporates the bias into the model, it can continue to generate new training data with enhanced bias. Moreover, some deviations may destroy people's lives. Be responsible: do not create self fulfilling prophecies.</p>
          <h3>10.AI is not self awakening, rebellion and destruction of human nature.</h3>
          <p>Quite a lot of people seem to get the concept of artificial intelligence from science fiction movies. We should be inspired by science fiction, but we should not be so foolish as to mistake fiction for reality. From conscious evil humans to unconscious biased machine learning models, there are too many realities and dangers to worry about. So you don't have to worry about SkyNet and superintelligence.</p>
