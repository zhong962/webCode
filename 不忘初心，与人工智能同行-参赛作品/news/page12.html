        <h1 class="title">In the era of AI, how does Qualcomm lead the next revolution through 5G?</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>On May 24, 2018, at the Qualcomm Artificial Intelligence Forum, Qualcomm President Christiano Amon used the above remark to look forward to the general trend of technological development. In Amon's view, 5G and AI have undoubtedly become the two keywords of current technological development; compared with the 4G era, the coordinated development of the two will undoubtedly bring greater changes to the entire technological development.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p111.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>More importantly, in the context of artificial intelligence, as the forerunner and leader of 5G development, Qualcomm has great opportunities for development.</p>
          <h3>Take the lead in the field of 5G</h3>
          <p>For Qualcomm, which started in the mobile communication industry, after winning the opportunity of 3G and 4G development, 5G is undoubtedly a must-have. It is precisely because of this, Qualcomm not only attaches great importance to 5G strategically, from the tactical point of view, Qualcomm is from a very early start of 5G layout, to now is in a leading position.</p>
          <p>Lei Feng learned that, in fact, Qualcomm's investment in 5G R&amp;D can be traced back to 10 years ago; and the technology patents and R&amp;D achievements accumulated during the development of Qualcomm's 2G/3G/4G also provide important support for Qualcomm's advanced 5G layout. As a result, Qualcomm has spared no effort to devote itself to the development of mobile communication as it moves towards 5G. Both for mobile operators and system equipment manufacturers and for intelligent terminal equipment manufacturers, Qualcomm has played an important role in standard setting, industry cooperation and technology landing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p112.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Taking 5G standard setting as an example, when the 3GPP 5G standardization process started, Qualcomm contributed its innovative design achievements in the 5G field to 3GPP, including OFDM-based waveform, advanced channel coding and more technologies. By December 21, 2017, with the important participation of Qualcomm, the first implementation of the new 5G air gap specification was successfully completed at the 3GPP TSG RAN plenary meeting in Lisbon. The completion of this specification has laid the foundation for the global mobile industry to open a new 5G air port in an all-round way and to realize the large-scale test and commercial deployment of the new 5G air port as soon as possible in 2019.</p>
          <p>Of course, in fact, Qualcomm had made great achievements in 5G industry cooperation before the above specification was completed. On November 17, 2017, Qualcomm cooperated with China Mobile to successfully implement the world's first 3GPP R15-based end-to-end 5G NR system interoperability (IoDT). It can be said that the successful interoperability of the end-to-end 5G new air port system is an important industry milestone for 5G new air port technology to large-scale pre-commercial.</p>
          <p>However, the most notable development of Qualcomm in 5G development is its ability and speed to achieve 5G landing.</p>
          <p>As early as September 2016, Qualcomm announced the world's first 5G-enabled modem at the 4G/5G summit and named it the Mirage X50. Since then, Qualcomm has continued to improve and innovate on the Mirage X50. In March 2017, Qualcomm announced that the Geolong X50 will achieve full frequency coverage, with a single chip to achieve 2G/3G/4G/5G multi-mode functions.</p>
          <p>By October 2017, Qualcomm announced at its 4G/5G summit that the single-chip-based MYLON X50 5G modem had achieved the world's first 5G network data connection; at the summit, Qualcomm also demonstrated its first MYLON X50 5G smartphone reference design.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p113.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Comparatively, however, Qualcomm's 5G module solution, released on MWC 2018, has a far-reaching impact on Qualcomm itself and the entire smartphone industry, especially smartphones. The whole solution aims to allow smartphone manufacturers to deploy 5G quickly in 2019. In Lei Feng's view, the whole solution is simple, fast and space-saving, providing mobile phone manufacturers a convenient way to embark on 5G; and the 5G key components such as radio frequency and modem included in this solution, the world can provide almost all manufacturers at the same time only Qualcomm.</p>
          <p>Overall, Qualcomm is playing a key role as a leader and facilitator as the world's first 5G modem, the world's first 5G network connection, and the world's first 5G module moves from concept to ground.</p>
          <h3>5G development in the age of AI</h3>
          <p>Of course, at the same time, Qualcomm is also actively embracing the development trend of artificial intelligence, and gives its own business development status of many important layout. Specifically, Qualcomm chose to focus on promoting end-to-side AI, on the one hand by adding AIE engines to the Mylon mobile platform, on the other hand, by continuing to explore and promote its AI strategy in the Internet of Things and autopilot areas.</p>
          <p>Lei FengNet believes that with the support of end-to-side AI strategy, Qualcomm 5G will gain more development advantages and broader development scenarios.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, super-high-speed, low-latency 5G network support includes many intelligent devices to connect to the cloud quickly, and obtain unlimited storage and data in the cloud, while on the edge of the terminal with processing capacity for perception, reasoning and action; the combination of the two, can maximize the release of the potential of end-to-side artificial intelligence, so that Smart devices reduce the dependence on the cloud, while enhancing the capabilities of the two party in data transmission and communication. From this point of view, Qualcomm 5G will undoubtedly bring about tremendous changes to many industries that rely heavily on cloud processing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p114.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>On the other hand, ultra-high-speed, low-latency 5G connections can be connected to additional processors in addition to the Internet. This means that Qualcomm can combine the edge processing capability of mobile terminal with 5G perfectly, which will bring enormous computing power to the terminal. For example, with the X50 5G modem mounted on the Mirage mobile platform, users can enjoy unparalleled VR experience, through the wireless edge of the ability to process the experience can only be enjoyed in a dedicated game PC.</p>
          <p>It can be said that the importance of 5G for AI lies in that it greatly clears the physical boundaries between end-to-side AI and cloud services, allowing AI to be used in more end-to-side devices; embodied in specific products, 5G greatly promotes AI for smartphones, all-in-one. PC, wireless VR / AR, smart speakers and even the Internet of Things, industrial detection, intelligent manufacturing, automatic driving and other equipment to achieve a better interconnection between people and people, things and things, people and things.</p>
          <p>As Cristiano Amon, the president of Qualcomm, said, in addition to smart phones, the development of 5G and AI technology covered the industry that previously wireless communication could not involve, such as key technologies in industry, including automatic driving, intelligent manufacturing and so on. In the future, the potential of 5G will be limitless not only in the wireless communications industry, but also in all industries - when devices are connected, huge forces such as big data, digital economy and many intelligent connected devices can be combined.</p>
          <p>So Qualcomm embraces AI at the same time on the basis of force 5G, which is the result of the whole AI from cloud side to end side. In Lei Feng's view, Qualcomm's dual strategy on AI and 5G undoubtedly conforms to the historical trend of the development of mobile communications and artificial intelligence.</p>
