          <p>Everything is interconnected and everything becomes highly intelligent. With the rapid evolution of wisdom, the future is constantly being refreshed. Artificial intelligence brings about changes in human society not only to extend human physical and mental, but also into the era of human and machine co-evolution. Artificial intelligence has become a topic that can not be ignored in enterprise management and talent management.</p>
          <p>On June 14, 2018, under the care and guidance of the Construction Office of Shanghai Promoting Science and Technology Innovation Center, Shanghai Labor Service Information Technology Co., Ltd., Pudong New Area Innovation Entrepreneurs Association, Shanghai Zhangjiang Founder Alliance Party Building Work Guidance Station, Shanghai Zhangjiang Founder Alliance Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Center and Shanghai Founder Space Investment Management Collection The 2008 Shanghai International Summit on Artificial Intelligence Innovation and Application and China Labor Force Innovation Research Forum co-sponsored by the Group Limited opened at the Ritz-Carlton Pudong Hotel.</p>

          <p>The activities were guided by the Shanghai Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Center, the United Front Department of the Pudong New Area Committee, the Organization Department of the Pudong New Area Committee, the Development and Reform Commission of the Pudong New Area, the Science and Economic Commission of the Pudong New Area and the Business Committee of the Pudong New Area. At the same time, it gathers the world-renowned experts and scholars, HR executives of the top 500 enterprises, and the leading enterprises in the artificial intelligence industry. From the perspective of globalization, it explores the current experience of artificial intelligence in enterprise management, innovative applications, project landing and other fields, and further looks forward to the future trend of artificial intelligence in the transformation of Chinese enterprises'intelligence. .</p>
          <p>Huang Lihong, deputy director of Shanghai Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Center, pointed out in a speech at the Innovation Forum that in order to achieve "by 2020, the overall technology and application of artificial intelligence will keep pace with the world's advanced level", Shanghai will be in the forefront of the country, and it will also need to tackle the key problems and climb vigorously.</p>
          <p>In their speeches, Wang Youbao, Dean of the Institute of Labor Force Research, and Zhu Chengyi, chairman of the Shanghai Zhangjiang Founder Alliance, pointed out that more and more traditional industries are starting to "hand in hand" with artificial intelligence, and that Labor Force will join hands with the Zhangjiang Founder Alliance in the field of artificial intelligence research and work together with enterprises to deepen integration and cooperation. Win, adhere to the "innovation, forward-looking, exploration" concept, gather the strength of enterprises and experts, carefully planned, carefully organized, focused on artificial intelligence issues, for the Chinese enterprise management cohesion, improve quality and efficiency.</p>
          <p>The keynote speeches at the China Labor Force Research and Innovation Forum in the morning were Li Kecun, Vice-President of Xiexin University, The Way of Enterprise Change in the Age of Wisdom Sharing, Pu Jianping, Director of Human Resources in Greater China of Basf, The Way of HR Transition in the Age of Intelligent Manufacturing, and Wang Lan, Mr. "Blue collar labor management reform", and warmly discuss with the guests at the scene.</p>

          <p>Subsequently, the key data of the 2018 China intellectual labor research was released. The report collected more than 500,000 anonymous data on manufacturing, service and retail industries from 2016 to 2017. According to the report, Chinese enterprises are transforming intelligent manufacturing by applying a large number of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, large data, cloud computing, Internet of Things, robotics and so on. At the same time, there are still many unsolved mysteries about the high overtime and turnover rate. The key data of this study is for these two seemingly unrelated, in fact, there are countless observation data, put forward a lot of business managers to ponder the point of view to share.</p>
          <p>The Innovation Forum in the afternoon was held by Yu Jingyi, Vice Dean of Information College of Shanghai University of Science and Technology, and Ye Shiqing, School of Information, Fudan University. The participants enjoyed the development opportunities and challenges of artificial intelligence.</p>
          <p>Michael I. Jordan, the world-class champion in the field of artificial intelligence, held an audiovisual banquet for The Future of Artificial Intelligence: Challenges and Opportunities.</p>
          <p>In his keynote speech, Michael I. Jordan pointed out that past technological advances were mainly about improving the ability to perform specific tasks. Today AI is endowed with machine response and adaptability to optimize output. By combining with the Internet of Things, robotics and other technologies, artificial intelligence can construct an integrated information physical world.</p>
          <p>Most of today's work will be automated around 2055, but there are many variables involved. If automation advances quickly, it may be 20 years ahead of schedule; if it advances slowly, it may be 20 years behind schedule. The development of artificial intelligence in China is mostly driven by technology enterprises.</p>
