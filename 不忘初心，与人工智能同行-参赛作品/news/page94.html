        <div class="two">
          <p>Sound Hound, AI's voice assistant, received $100 million in strategic financing from investors including Tencent, Daimler, Hyundai, America and Orange S.A. In addition to these investors, investors already have Samsung, NVIDIA, South Korea Telecom, HTC and so on.</p>
          <p>Sound Hound will accelerate its international expansion of its Houdify Voice Artificial Intelligence Platform, set up new offices in China, France and Germany, introduce new language recognition, and integrate its language technology into homes and cars.</p>
          <p>Keyvan Mohajer, founder and CEO of Sound Hound, said: "It's rare for Sound Hound to enter a foreign company that's often successful in China, and Google and Facebook haven't taken this big cake. This is a signal for SoundHound, and the strategy to enter China needs to be cautious.</p>
          <p>So this round of financing is strategic financing, and the resources of investors are even more important. Among the investors, Tencent's huge user base and the U.S. home furnishings are self-evident in the significance of Sound Hound's entry into China; Daimler and Hyundai may help Sound Hound's Houdify connect to its onboard system; and the resources of French Telecom Company Orange S.A. among the investors will help Sound Hound set up in France. Office?</p>
          <p>Many people may think of Sound Hound as a song hunter, but in fact, Sound Hound has been working on artificial intelligence applications, including music recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Sound Hound has been plugged into Android and IOS systems for a long time and has been learning data in a variety of environments for 10 years. Its performance is leading the industry.</p>
          <p>Speaking about Google's voice assistant and Amazon's Alexa, Mohajer said: "Houndify's technology is prior to Google and Amazon, and obviously good ideas are always copied. "At present, SoundHound also has its own voice recognition software Hound. When using Hound, the company says, it can still identify 12 points in a user's sentence and feed back a good search result to the user. And when using Sound Hound's various voice recognition tools, you don't need to repeatedly emphasize the name of Sound Hound to wake up the device, unlike most other voice assistants.</p>
          <p>A report by Yiguan in 2017 predicted that the scale of China's voice industry would exceed 10 billion yuan in 2017; the smart voice market as a whole is in its infancy, and is on the eve of an explosion in vertical areas such as smart cars, smart homes and smart wearables. In addition, the domestic Internet giants will open up the voice ecosystem, in the way of intra-industry cooperation, the voice technology implanted in products or applied to related business scenarios, to build an eco-industrial chain. The intelligent voice market will soon usher in an outbreak period.</p>
