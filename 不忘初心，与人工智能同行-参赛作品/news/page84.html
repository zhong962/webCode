        <div class="two">
          <p>Recently, the official website of Nanjing University officially released news, after research and decision, Nanjing University officially established the Academy of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
          <p>Nanjing University said that under the background of the new stage of the development of artificial intelligence, Nanjing University has set up the College of Artificial Intelligence, aiming at conforming to the national science and technology development strategy, meeting the needs of industrial development, giving full play to the discipline development and talent training advantages of Nanjing University in the direction of artificial intelligence, and forming high-end talents. Accumulation effect, explore the new mode of industry-university-research cooperation in intelligent industry, and make an important contribution to promote China's dominant position in the new round of international competition.</p>
          <p>It is reported that Nanjing University hopes that the admission work of the Academy of Artificial Intelligence can begin this year, and the specific work progress is still under negotiation. The establishment of the Academy of Artificial Intelligence in Nantah is regarded as an important measure to conform to the development trend of international science and technology, create an ecological system for Discipline development, and better serve the national and local construction.</p>
          <p>Actually, Nanjing University is not the first AI school in China. In May 28, 2017, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences issued the text of the Institute of artificial intelligence technology. This is the first new school in the field of artificial intelligence technology to carry out teaching and scientific research in China. In November of the same year, the school of artificial intelligence of Xi'an Electronic and Science University was officially set up. It is the first substantive college directly affiliated to the Ministry of Education, which is dedicated to the cultivation of high-end talents in the field of artificial intelligence, the research and development of innovative achievements and the cultivation of high-level teams. On January 13 and 18, 2018, Hunan University of Technology and Shanghai Jiaotong University also established the Institute of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
          <p>According to reports, Wu Fei, Vice-Dean of the School of Computer Science of Zhejiang University and Director of the Institute of Artificial Intelligence of Zhejiang University, said that there is no artificial intelligence major for undergraduates in China. Artificial intelligence is a research direction in computer science, and it is related to informatics, computer science and technology, control science and software engineering. Cheng and statistical mathematics are closely related. At present, some universities have set up data science related majors, directly docking applications in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
          <p>Yang Fangchun, a professor at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and executive vice chairman of the Chinese Association of Artificial Intelligence, pointed out in an interview with the media, "Because AI is not a first-class discipline, teaching and scientific research activities related to artificial intelligence are scattered among many other first-class disciplines. Intelligence courses are not the focus of learning, and the proportion of school hours is also small. However, there are still some problems such as high opening, low walking, fragmentation and low level repetition, which seriously hinder the development of intelligent science and technology in China and the cultivation of intelligent and technical personnel.</p>
          <p>With the advent of the Plan, colleges and universities around the country have begun to prepare for the establishment of artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence colleges. For example, recently the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences officially announced the establishment of the Academy of Artificial Intelligence Technology, becoming the first comprehensive teaching and scientific research in the field of artificial intelligence technology in China.</p>
