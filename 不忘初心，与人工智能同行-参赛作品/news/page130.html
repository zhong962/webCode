          <p>We all hate the traffic jam. In addition to giving people headaches and missing appointments, traffic jams cost American drivers more than 300 billion dollars a year. The researchers suggest that if you use autopilot cars, even if the number is not large, it will also greatly improve traffic congestion. Lex Fridman and his MIT team developed a simulation game to speed up the realization of the future.</p>
          <p>DeepTraffic simulates a typical road environment in which players use in-depth learning techniques to control their cars. This mock game allows beginners to access and use complex technical concepts, while also driving experts to develop new technologies.</p>
          <h3>Traffic games using neural networks</h3>
          <p>Suppose you drive on a crowded highway in Losangeles. You must determine the distance between you and the front car, when to change lanes, and how to avoid hitting other vehicles. This is called path planning. With DeepTraffic, anyone can design and train a deep neural network to perform these functions.</p>
          <p>At the GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Silicon Valley last month, Fridman described the design principles of the game based on reinforcement learning. It achieves AI by rewarding the specified actions by the neural network. By repeatedly training and rewarding, the neural network finally learns how to run.</p>
          <p>In this game, neural networks control a red car on a crowded highway, with the goal of crossing the highway as quickly as possible. Beginners can use the browser to control the parameters and change the driving of the car. Advanced players can access DeepTraffic using OpenAI Gym and train the network through any Python interface provided by OpenAI Gym.</p>

          <p>DeepTraffic was originally developed by Fridman in MIT in order to give students lessons. When the course and the game were open to the public, they were welcomed and 12,000 people have submitted their models so far. The list of the fastest drivers in the game and the fastest in the neural network was recorded.</p>
          <p>The fun of games comes from the competition between players, and the bonus in the real world is much higher. Automated vehicles have to plan a safe route to their destination. This process is quite complicated and AI must be used. Educational tools such as Deep Traffic can help train AI developers as well as bring solutions that change the car ecosystem to life.</p>
          <p>You can find the complete speech of Fridman on GTC (including PDF and MP4) here. You can also learn about the hierarchy of path planning, the strengths and weaknesses of reinforcement learning, and the technical details of DeepTraffic network training.</p>
