          <p>Machine learning can help companies make better decisions, but puppy cycles are often short. This paper analyzes eight methods of machine learning, which can help enterprises to maximize the probability of success.</p>

          <p>How long does hip replacement take?</p>
          <p>This is not an academic issue for hospitals. In 2015, hospitals had about $36 billion in unpaid health care costs, most of which came from patients'unpaid bills. A solution to this problem is to limit the cost associated with surgery, but how can it be achieved? The answer is machine learning. Hospitals now use predictive analysis to predict the average operation time and potential problems, such as hip surgery.</p>
          <p>For example, health care buyer data show patient age, core health care providers, and secondary diagnosis. Using machine learning and predictive analysis, data can estimate future costs and help identify patients who may have problems with recovery. This will enable hospitals to make better clinical decisions, reduce secondary admission rates, shorten hospital stay, and provide better care.</p>
          <p>In the process of using machine learning to analyze data, enterprises everywhere find similar practical results. But the problem is that the effect cycle is often short. Mike Gaultieri, an analyst at Forrester Research, points out that machine learning is not like traditional business intelligence, and the results are certain. "If you're looking for a machine learning model, you can say'I'll try', but you may not succeed," he said. Businesses should understand that just because they want to have a model for predicting the stock market doesn't mean they're going to get there.</p>
          <p>DXC Technical Analysis Data Laboratory is the Global Research Center for data scientists, who focus on consulting and finding ways to implement analysis. Rags Raghavendra, the head of the lab, says business performance is frustrating because they tend to bear too much burden. "Customers tend to be ambitious when they try to dig the meaning of all kinds of data that they have access to," he said. We propose to focus on the data that we can access, and then take the next step.</p>
          <p>If an enterprise tries but fails to extract useful information from the data, it should first accept that failure and repetition are part of the process. But by using machine learning more cleverly, they can maximize the chance of success. Here are eight ways to use machine learning:</p>
          <h3>Start with the problem you want to solve</h3>
          <p>It is wrong to directly study data and expect to find useful information immediately. The right approach to data research begins with determining the right performance metrics that link business results to data-related issues. However, the criteria should be appropriate. For example, when DXC recently worked with media companies to explain why subscribers left, the most intuitive criterion was "subscriber base." It turns out that the relevant criterion is the average income per user (ARPU), which is directly related to the larger business objectives set by the company to increase revenue.</p>
          <h3>Industrialization of machine learning process</h3>
          <p>"The whole process of big data analysis is not yet industrialized," says Raghavendra, whose labs support industries including manufacturing, telecommunications, automobiles, aviation, energy, financial services and health care. "A lot of times, you analyze and analyze again or again." DXC is a staunch supporter of industrial machine learning. This learning model is simple and efficient. It holds that all stages of analysis, from extracting and cleaning data to constructing algorithms, to putting them into production and getting useful information, should be reused and deployed in enterprise technology.</p>
          <h3>No need to worry about silos</h3>
          <p>Silos are a disaster for many companies working on data mining projects because they prevent access to a unified data pool. But silos are not as big obstacles as some people think. "If you have smart data and platform strategy, you don't have to worry about silos," Raghavendra said. In short, as long as it is not the problem you choose to solve, you need not worry about it. However, you should be prepared to solve future problems by integrating different data sources. "Flexible and modular platforms allow you to integrate data when needed," Raghavendra added.</p>
          <h3>Thinking about external procedures</h3>
          <p>You don't always have all the information, talent, analysis and intelligence. It's an ecosystem issue, and those who tap into the power of things around them will win. Crowdsourcing data scientists, machine learning and external data sets have great potential.</p>
          <h3>Using data Lake</h3>
          <p>Data lakes are repositories. No matter how they are, you can store all the existing data as they are. Raghavendra says companies should put all their data in a data lake, even if at first they didn't know how to use it. But don't start thinking about building data lakes.</p>
          <h3>Carrying out exploratory data analysis with objectives (EDA)</h3>
          <p>The first stage of data mining is EDA, which aims to summarize visual and non visual data. Bharathan Shamasundar, senior DXC data scientist, said: "I find that exploratory data analysis is always kept in silos. "The purpose of EDA is to provide insights on data patterns and inform people what to do next. But usually, the company is just acting. The experience of DXC and energy company emphasizes the importance of intelligent EDA. The utility company is working hard to accurately predict the amount of energy generated by wind turbines. Because the company applied EDA to algorithms, the DXC team attacked existing standards that say that turbines spend 95 percent of their time performing, albeit with fewer variables. This experience shows that meaningful EDAs (done ahead of time) will often produce algorithms that fit existing data.</p>
          <h3>Using intelligent sampling</h3>
          <p>One reason why companies can't get useful information from big data is that they use too much. Shamasundar said, "the word" sampling "has become very offensive. Data sampling is very wise for processing data. " Usually, big data seems to be full of redundant information. For commodity trading companies, DXC determines that most of the data stored is redundant because 94% of its trade transactions are based on a smaller subset of data. This indicates that the quality and relevance of evaluation is an important part of data strategy.</p>
          <h3>Developing flexible operation mode for data science plan</h3>
          <p>Raghavendra recommends: do not launch data analysis procedures because you can not hire data scientists. Demand for data scientists is now 60% higher than it is today, and there is no sign that the gap is narrowing. Raghavendra says that if companies are not equipped with enough data scientists, they should consider using collaborations that provide expert analysis support and "citizen data scientists". Citizen data scientists understand the areas and business operations of employers' businesses. They can use existing analysis platforms to perform reasonable analysis, which simplify some of the tasks of data mining. As enterprises leverage analysis to solve problems, partners can help extend programs and build deeper capabilities in multiple areas.</p>
          <p>Although these guidelines can improve the chances of success, enterprises need to remember that failure is also real. Based on the proof or refutation hypothesis, data science uses scientific methods to study data. The use of data should be regarded as a research and development activity. "It's better to have six or a dozen ideas and implement them at the same time, because not all ideas work," says Gualtieri, who studies data queries.</p>
          <p>With the increasing amount of data, challenges will become more and more difficult. On the other hand, the more data we have, the greater the potential reward. According to Dave Aron, director of research at the DXC Thought Leadership Forums, many companies still view their most important assets as material and financial.</p>
          <p>"Over the next decade, companies will see information as an asset, building and improving their analysis and learning platforms," Aron said. The Internet of things and the increasing number of data protection legislation make this problem more and more important. Benefiting from the data, hospitals, utilities, and any other business will adopt a prudent strategy, determined to use and respect scientific methods.</p>
