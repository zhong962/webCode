        <h1 class="title">How does the humanities embrace AI?</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is now a hot issue of concern to the whole society. Generally speaking, we believe that AI is mainly a matter of natural science, and it is difficult for humanities to relate to AI. However, it must be seen that artificial intelligence, as a technology that will completely transform the whole social life, will also completely transform the way and connotation of academic research. Therefore, we might as well face the tides and think about the relationship between AI and the humanities. Because, in the next ten or twenty years, there will be no way out for Humanities research, and there is no other choice but to face up to this great change.</p>
          <p>As a literary and aesthetic researcher, I am concerned about the question of "artificial intelligence and aesthetics". How to combine the two?</p>
          <p>"Microsoft Xiaobing" is the most famous AI of literature and art. For Xiao Bing's poetry creation, there are often two opposing concepts: one is that Xiao Bing is not a poet, because Xiao Bing is not a man, is a machine, no creativity, so it can not create poetry. Another idea is that Xiao Bing created poetry, which has a unique creativity, but we do not know where this creativity comes from. The difficulty with this view is to answer what creativity is, and if it's mysterious and can't be explained, is it because it doesn't exist or because we can't understand it?</p>
          <p>The mystery of creativity is a long-standing concept in aesthetics. But "Microsoft Xiaobing" gives us an opportunity to understand people from the perspective of AI. If Xiaobing is creative, what is creativity? Xiao Bing's "creation" should be regarded as an algorithm. Its effect is basically the same as that of human poems. The controversy focuses on the mechanism. If we interpret creativity as an "algorithm," can we solve the aesthetic problem of artificial intelligence? Artificial intelligence can even be regarded as the key to understanding human creativity from an aesthetic point of view, so that the object of aesthetic research is no longer limited to humans, but also includes artificial intelligence in comparison with humans, and there is an interactive relationship between algorithm and creativity.</p>
          <p>Of course, such considerations must not be limited to the current industrial development of artificial intelligence, but also include the future prospects, or theoretical assumptions. On the topic of artificial intelligence and aesthetics, if we imagine an artificial intelligence to achieve aesthetic judgment, what way should it be achieved? To answer this question, we must discuss the aesthetic modeling of artificial intelligence, that is, how to establish an algorithm for aesthetic judgment.</p>
          <p>As far as I understand, if AI is to achieve aesthetic judgment, there are roughly two basic modeling methods: one is Kantian, the other is Wittgenstein. Simply put, Kantian modeling emphasizes the combination of underlying rules in order to achieve overall judgment, and its basic rules must be very solid, which can be called the lowest logic, each step of derivation must be solid, so as to achieve such an inevitable aesthetic judgment. Wittgenstein's approach is totally different. He pays more attention to language training and denies the existence of the essence of universality. If you take a little risk, you can analogize his method to "big data", emphasizing the training after modeling, emphasizing output management. AI modeling is more popular now. Both Kantian and Wittgenstein analyses are human-based, and it takes a lot of work to "transporte" them to AI.</p>
          <p>The human mind is already a fact, it is there, no matter what the observer thinks, it is already there, able to judge, but once added to artificial intelligence, things have changed dramatically - now the mind, creativity, aesthetic judgment and so on seem to disappear, but the output of artificial intelligence may be with How do we understand the same result of human output? This is not a simple question to answer, we can only put it as a task to explore, perhaps different views collide with each other, can gradually open up ideas, to find new directions.</p>
