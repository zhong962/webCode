        <h1 class="title">Using AI empowerment education, ROOBO releases child intelligence platform "Tong Mi".</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>According to public data, China's educational robot market has been growing steadily since 2011. With the support of national policy, consumption upgrade and the promotion of all-round second child, the educational robot market in 2017 has developed to 4-5 million units, and the market in 2018 has ushered in an outbreak period. It is expected that this year's domestic market will be in full swing. The scale will exceed 20 million units to achieve multiple growth.</p>
          <p>In addition, the richness of categories is also expanding, industry players from traditional toys, digital, mobile phone flat panel brand expanded to mother and baby, education platform, e-commerce and micro-commodity brands and channels, the robot market has been closely watched by the industry. Such huge industry potential brings new opportunities to educational robots.</p>
          <h2>From product to AI platform</h2>
          <p>ROOBO was founded in 2014, since its inception, the company has launched a number of outstanding robot products such as pudding, pudding beans, Domgy, Jelly, and so on. It has won IF, Red Dot of best and many other international authoritative creative awards, it can be said that in the field of educational robot hardware has become a benchmark enterprise in the field of domestic educational robot. One of.</p>
          <p>But from the current wave of artificial intelligence can be seen that it is difficult to achieve great success in hardware companies alone, and it is difficult to bring any substantial changes to the industry, so many artificial intelligence companies have slowly shifted to platform companies to build their own ecosystem, ROOBO is no exception. In September last year, at a new ROOBO financing conference, the company announced that it would upgrade its strategy from AI products to AI platforms, and officially launched an AI platform, ROS.AI. After continuous polishing, ROS.AI has become the backbone of ROOBO's entry into the AI platform.</p>
          <p>On July 27, ROOBO held a children's intelligence platform conference in Shenzhen, at which the latest research and development results of ROS.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>The event lasted more than three hours and was more like a corporate forum than an ordinary vendor event. At the meeting, ROOBO also invited a series of important partners in the ROOBO industry chain ecology, such as RT-Thread COO Zou Cheng, Senior Product Manager of Microsoft's cloud computing and artificial intelligence division, Liao Qinying, and Chen Wanqing, general manager of New Oriental Online's children's products division, to share their knowledge and understanding of the industry.</p>
          <h2>Children's intelligence platform for children</h2>
          <p>ROOBO launched the ROS.AI-based Children's Intelligent Platform - "Children's Secret" at the press conference. It is understood that the platform can provide overall intelligent solutions and technical services for children's education robot enterprises. It has a perfect three-terminal communication architecture, namely SDK on the device side, APP / public number on the mobile phone, and supports RTOS and L. Inux and Android three big hardware platforms.</p>
          <p>According to the introduction, Children's Secret built-in by ROOBO self-developed children's ASR engine, the engine for children's voice and specific scenarios for customized optimization, with hundreds of millions of real children's dialogue corpus. Children's Secret ASR engine uses the latest acoustic model network structure, namely the wide field of vision and high resolution TDNN model, combined with advanced voice knowledge transfer technology, to build a children's exclusive voice model. Simply put, children speak in different ways and sounds from adults, with a sharp voice, broken sentences unclear, grammatical chaos and other characteristics, so for children to optimize the corpus, the robot can more easily understand what children say.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>According to ROOBO's introduction, according to ROS.AI's excellent results, Tong's performance is pretty good. In 2017, about 1.5 million children's robots were shipped with the Children's Secret Platform. In 2018, the number was more than 10 million, with a monthly voice interaction exceeding 1 billion. ROOBO through the platform to complete the original data accumulation, in the massive use of data, ROOBO can be based on the frequency of use, long-term use, user stickiness to determine the popularity of content, function, and then help enterprises optimize more popular products for children.</p>
          <p>In addition to technology realization, Tong MI has focused on content operation and built up its own brand barriers. ROOBO believes that the satisfaction of children's educational robots ultimately lies in the comprehensiveness and richness of the scene on demand. Combined with the platform statistics, Tong Mi has established close cooperation with New Oriental, Pocket Story, Chinese Animation, Good Future, QQ Music, Little Penguin Paradise and other content partners, and has access to a large number of genuine resources.</p>
          <p>At the press conference, ROOBO teaching and research team made its debut. Members of the teaching and research team have been in the education industry for many years, and are currently responsible for designing robot teaching content according to the age of children.</p>
          <p>ROOBO focuses on the four teaching skills of children's secret English vocabulary learning, oral English practice, Chinese poetry interaction skills and card recognition based on image recognition technology. This series of teaching skills research and development, based on children's cognitive level and language learning characteristics, adopt the guiding exploratory teaching concept, use professional teaching methods to dismantle the whole teaching link, increase the frequency of interaction; from the subtle point of view, from shallow to deep, gradually guide children from the interest, through the game learning method In playing secondary school, we should actively explore the teaching objectives of learning.</p>
          <h2>Cooperation with Microsoft and RT-Thread</h2>
          <p>In the field, the platform has been recognized by international manufacturers, ROOBO also showed their cooperation with Microsoft, RT-Thread case.</p>
          <p>With Microsoft, in May this year on the Build 2018, Microsoft CEO Nadela officially released the Microsoft Voice Team jointly with ROOBO to develop a multi-MIC voice development board MSDDK, for far-field voice recognition software and hardware integration program. This is the first developer hardware platform Microsoft has provided in the AI field so far.</p>
          <p>In addition, Microsoft and ROOBO have collaborated on a smart desktop device for multi-person meetings, which can record the voice and images of multi-person meetings, mark and transcribe the speeches of different people, and archive and extract key issues or summaries separately. This product is also co operated by Microsoft and ROOBO to excavate the technological potential of DDK development board.</p>
          <p>While ROOBO and RT-Thread focus on AI ecosystem collaboration, aiming to build AI-enabled Internet of Things operating systems.</p>
          <h2>Future of platform</h2>
          <p>This is what ROOBO CEO Liu Yingbo said at the opening of the conference, which contains ROOBO's vision for future development - linking mature supply chains to become a better, highly operational artificial intelligence platform. At present, ROOBO has a very good experience in hardware development, platform layout is also going smoothly, based on the education industry for deep cultivation, clear objectives, clear strategy, coupled with artificial intelligence is in its infancy, education robot market potential is huge, ROOBO future development is very worthy of expectation.</p>
