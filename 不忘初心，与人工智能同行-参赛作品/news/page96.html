        <div class="two">
          <p>People often ask me, what is the future of AI? What are your expectations for the future? I would usually say that the development of the ecology of those financial technology companies will be the most interesting part of AI in the future. "Michael I. Jordan, a pioneer in machine learning and chairman of the Golden Ant Science Think Tank and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p951.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Indeed, these companies face real industry challenges, and they are where AI applications are most effective. "We're starting to see that AI is no longer simply trying to mimic human intelligence, it's becoming a new ability. It permeates every corner of the social economy like water, distributing intelligence and solving problems. "Ant gold clothing CTO Cheng Li explains.</p>
          <p></p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p952.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>The ability to unleash such AI can not only help people gain a deeper insight into society, better identify and control risks in the financial field, but also create a close life assistant and wealth consultant for every ordinary person, so that every small and micro enterprise has the most intelligent business assistant and the best CFO. .</p>
          <p>On April 25, the ATEC Ant Developer Competition started, and the sponsor Ant Golden Clothes was launched to refine the most valuable issues in the business system, and to provide an autonomous and controllable AI platform for developers to share with innovative technology solutions.</p>
          <p>In fact, AI is an engineering discipline. Sometimes people think that AI is a magic tool. Introducing AI into a company can bring miracles. It's not true. "AI is a problem solving tool created by the engineer's brain, a way of thinking about problem solving," says Michael I. Jordan. Today's contest is a great example of how to solve problems with engineers'minds, not with magic.</p>
          <p>To some extent, for these contestants, it is more like completing real projects at a technology finance company than participating in a competition. We have a thorough understanding of the topics around the specific financial business scenarios on the spot, and have found some solutions from the introduction of experts.</p>
          <h3>One,Payment risk identification</h3>
          <p>While the new financial business based on mobile Internet is booming, the ability of black industry to attack is also upgrading. Information leakage is one of the most serious problems of account security. There have been many cases of user information leakage in the world. More than 100 million sensitive data have been embezzled and used, which has brought huge economic losses to users and banks.</p>
          <p>The protection of consumers and risk identification has increasingly become the focus of attention in the financial industry and academia. Starting from this research point, Ant Golden Clothing highly simulates real business data and scenarios, hoping that the industry coffee together on the risk model, unlabeled data learning these two technical difficulties to make in-depth research and breakthroughs, for the financial wind control industry to bring value and promote the next step in the development of artificial intelligence.</p>
          <p>At the event site, Rui Xiongwen, vice president of Ant Golden Wear and head of Great Safety, introduced the background of the competition. Alipay is the origin of ant suits, and the fundamental reason for the popularity of mobile payment in China is that, compared with credit cards, mobile payment based on two dimensional code basically reduces the payment threshold of consumers and merchants, and is lower than POS.</p>
          <p>In terms of security technology, Ant Gold Suit has three core competencies: ensuring the digital identity of the operator, i.e. the account owner, in the offline and offline environment; using large data, machine learning and artificial intelligence to achieve accurate identification and risk prevention of intelligent wind-controlled brain; and data protection from internal and external attacks. And privacy.</p>
          <h3>Two, intelligent financial customer service</h3>
          <p>The important goal of GSP Finance is to provide users with efficient and personalized customer service experience. Intelligent customer service with AI technology as the core plays an important role in improving the user experience.</p>
          <p>The essence of intelligent customer service is to fully understand the intention of users, accurately find the matching knowledge points in the knowledge base, so as to answer user questions or provide solutions. The whole intelligent customer service is built around the user problem, and the problem similarity calculation is the core technology that runs through the construction of intelligent customer service knowledge base, online problem matching, full-link data operation and almost all links. The development of this technology and the construction of related data will certainly promote the progress of the entire customer service industry. Step.</p>
          <p>At the core of the algorithm development, that is, in the process of building an artificial intelligence engine, ant golden suit has also encountered many challenges, such as making machine learning engine can quickly re-judge, how to face very small samples to achieve learning and prediction.</p>
          <p>"The first thing we do here is on intelligent customer service, hoping to make Alipay more intelligent through multiple rounds of dialogue, and understand the meaning behind the dialogue." Lacquer yuan added.</p>
          <p>This is very important in intelligent customer service, but behind it is not simple.</p>
          <p>First of all, the most important point of customer service is to understand the user's intentions, and then in the knowledge base to match the relevant knowledge points. At present, the most popular matching method in industry is to calculate the similarity between the user's questions and all the questions in the knowledge base one by one, take the most similar questions as the user's intention, and then return its answers to the user.</p>
          <p>Besides, similarity calculation is also meaningful for all aspects of customer service. For example, the knowledge base is actually used for text-based automatic mining, which is also based on computing the similarity between any two texts, or the distance between the two high-dimensional spaces.</p>
          <p>Similarity computing is also a very core and basic problem in all aspects of data operation, including search recommendation, dialogue and other fields.</p>
          <p>At present, the biggest challenge and problem of NLP similarity calculation is precisely that there are a lot of diversity problems in intelligent customer service, including dialects, spoken language and various expressions of the different places, the matching of the problem put forward quite high requirements. However, the progress of NLP mainly focuses on affective analysis and translation. In these scenarios, most of the time, it is in a relatively fixed data set, which can get good results on a relatively simple and clean data set.</p>
          <p>We often say in theory what we can do if we have large data, but it is difficult to achieve such an ideal environment in the actual engineering process. Whether it is transfer learning or unsupervised learning, how to use fewer samples to achieve higher accuracy, faster recognition rate, and improve the generalization ability of machine learning, are very challenging issues in the next stage.</p>
