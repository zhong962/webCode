        <h1 class="title">2018 AI World Cup war! Who will dominate in computer vision?</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>According to the recently published "IDC 2018 China Computer Vision Application Market Research", there are four small dragons in the field of artificial intelligence computer vision: Shangtang Technology, Yuncong Technology, Broadview Technology and Yitu Technology. Many people think that 2018 will be a year when computer vision seize the industry and further escalate the war. Before that, however, the four dragons have chosen their own direction and decided their future.</p>

          <img src="./pimg/p431.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>The two most distinctive unicorns of the four dragons are Shangtang Technology of the Financing School and Yuncong Technology of the Practical School.</p>
          <h3>Financing wild faction: Shang Tang Technology</h3>
          <p>Let's start with the famous Shang Tang technology.</p>
          <p>Shangtang Technology and China Mobile Online Services Limited (China Mobile Online) held a strategic cooperation agreement signing ceremony in Beijing to jointly accelerate the development of the artificial intelligence market. According to Soup from the media, recently released millet 8 and Oneplus 8 are also using Soup technology (including the Millet 8 Exploratory Edition). But according to Moving Point Technology and other media reports, Millet 8 Exploratory 3D structured light technology was developed independently by Israel's Mantis Vision.</p>
          <p>In April 2018 -5, within a month and a half, Shang Tang completed two rounds of financing. Financed up to $1 billion 220 million. Here is the question: why do companies need to raise large sums of money at such a high frequency?</p>
          <h3>Pragmatic literature and Art: cloud from technology</h3>
          <p>Yun is incubated in the Chinese Academy of Sciences from science and technology, and Bai Chunli, director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pays special attention to and inspects the enterprises several times. At the same time, it is also the Chinese AI enterprise that has the most self-control in the face of temptation. Except for Cloud Technologies, other companies have overseas capital, and Cloud Technologies has accepted only domestic capital from start to finish.</p>
          <p>Although the initiative to give up a large part of capital intervention, cloud from the ability to control the industry can not be underestimated. Yuncong is the largest AI supplier in the banking industry. On the "Top 100 Artificial Intelligence Business Landing List of China in 2018" just released by Euro 100, Yuncong and Shangtang are among the top companies in the forecast revenue of 1-2 billion yuan in 2018.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Perhaps the ability to control the industry has little to do with financing.</p>
          <p>The concern of the state has never been linked to financing.</p>
          <p>From May 28 to June 1, during the meeting of the academicians'Congress of the two academies, the designated Journal of the congress, China Science Journal, devoted a large amount of space to the introduction of Yuncong's achievements in the industrialization of science and technology in the second edition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p433.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>It is not only "investigation" and reporting, but also needs the cloud to support the country "to build the Chinese dream with artificial intelligence".</p>
          <p>In March 2017, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) decided that Yuncong Science and Technology and Baidu, Tencent, University of Science and Technology Flight, to undertake the "artificial intelligence basic resources public service platform" construction task. In January 2018, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) re-established Yuncong Science and Technology to undertake the "high accuracy face recognition system industrialization and application project" construction task.</p>
          <p>Cloud also has its own problems from technology: the core of R &amp; D team is strong, but the number is insufficient. In February, it announced the first domestic 3D structured light technology (IphoneX's FaceID). Other products are too pragmatic, while the industry deployment depth is large, but also to undertake the task of the national artificial intelligence platform, heavy burden. In addition to the already deep-ploughed finance, as well as security, airport three major industries, expanding more new industries will have more competitors.</p>
          <p>It remains to be seen whether the financialists headed by Shang Tang Technologies will win or whether the literary and artistic practitioners will overtake the technology at the curve. But it is for sure that there are still many good things to watch in the AI World Cup competition.</p>
