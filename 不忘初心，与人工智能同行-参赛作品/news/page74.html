          <p>According to foreign media reports, Google's Alphago program of DeepMind, an AI company, has become a rare milestone in the field of AI in recent years, beating South Korean Go champion Lee Se-dol. But AlphaGo is still a program, not even Google's main project. But Demis Hassabis, founder of DeepMind, said recently that DeepMind wanted to solve the "intellectual problem" and that he had a lot of ideas about how to achieve it.</p>
          <p>Hassabis himself has an unusual experience, but it seems very useful to achieve the goal of "solving intellectual problems". The chess prodigy, who won five Mind Sports Olympiad titles as Pentamind, rose to fame among British computer game developers Bullfrog and Lionhead as a young man and helped develop artificial intelligence games such as Theme Park and Black or White, has since been formed. Your own studio Elixir. In mid-2000, Hassabis left the game industry and received a doctorate in neuroscience, creating DeepMind in 2010.</p>
          <p>After Alpha Go's first victory over Lee, Hassabis was interviewed by Sam Byford, a journalist for The Verge, a US technology media site. In addition to discussing Alpha Go, he talked about video games, the next generation of smartphone assistants, DeepMind's role at Google, robots and how artificial intelligence can help science. Topics such as research.</p>
          <h3>1.AlphaGo has become the Holy Grail in the field of AI research.</h3>
          <p>BYFORD: For those who don't know much about AI or Alpha Go, how do you describe the "cultural resonance" that happened yesterday?</p>
          <p>Hassabis: AlphaGo has reached the pinnacle of the perfect information game. Go is far more complex than chess, so it has always been the Holy Grail or the Great Challenge to AI research, especially since Deep Blue. As we all know, despite our efforts, we still have a long way to go. Ten years ago, the Monte Carlo Tree search was a big innovation, but I think Alpha Go introduced intuitive neural networks, which are the key to distinguishing top chess players.</p>
          <p>Beford: when you see AlphaGo playing chess, are you surprised by its specific actions?</p>
          <p>Kazakhstan: I will, we are all very shocked. I think Li Shishi is the same. It can be seen from his facial expression. For example, when Alpha Go dropped the pieces to the left and went deep into Li Shishi's territory, I thought it was an unexpected move.</p>
          <p>BYFFORD: One of the important reasons for the initial sub-tournament was to assess Alpha Go's ability. What did you think of his first match with Li Shishi?</p>
          <p>Kazakhstan: I guess we should continue to study in the current direction. This is not what we expected. We told people that we thought the match was overwhelming. I think anything can happen. I know that Li Shishi may take different strategies. So I think the next match is worth looking forward to.</p>
          <p>I've just talked about the importance of Alpha Go for artificial intelligence research, and now I'll answer your first question: the difference between Alpha Go and dark blue. Deep Blue is a "hand-crafted" program where programmers filter the information of chess masters into specific rules and inspirations, and we implant learning skills into Alpha Go, which can accumulate more experience through practice and learning, much like humans.</p>
          <h3>2.it will eventually be used to solve the real world problems.</h3>
          <p>BYFORD: If Alpha Go continues to win in the same way, what's next? Will AI continue to play the human PK game in the future?</p>
          <p>Kazakhstan: I think Weiqi is the pinnacle of perfect information games. Of course, there may be other top Go masters fighting it, and some games are very difficult, and multiple players will be more challenging, because that will no longer be the perfect information game. In addition to a variety of video games, human performance is far more than the computer, such as the Korean game "StarCraft". In the imperfect information world, strategic games require a higher level of strategic ability, which is called "never perceive the whole world". In Go games, you can see the whole situation at a glance on the board, which is relatively easy for computers.</p>
          <p>Beford: is game the most obvious application of artificial intelligence?</p>
          <p>Kazakhstan: I think so. We are developing very advanced AI. When I was in college in the 1990s, these new technologies were not really popular, such as neural networks, in-depth learning, reinforcement learning, etc. Therefore, in fact, the best AI is applied to games. But they're not learning AI we're developing, they're finite-state machines, but they're still very complex. "Black or White" and other games use reinforcement learning technology, and I think it's still the most complex technology in the game. But between 2004 and 2005, the gaming industry was clearly different from the 1990s, becoming more interesting and creative, and you could develop any game just by inventing it. But this industry is no longer interesting, so I began to collect different information and prepare to create DeepMind. I wanted to be inspired by how the brain solves problems, so I chose to pursue a doctorate in neuroscience.</p>
          <h3>3.learning AI will improve the overall level of the game industry.</h3>
          <p>BYFORD: This may be a short-term achievable goal. Will you take advantage of artificial intelligence and apply it to today's games?</p>
          <p>Hassabis: Frankly speaking, artificial intelligence can be used in many fields, and I like to do that. But limited to bandwidth constraints, our focus will be on health care and recommender systems. But I think it's going to be a huge market, and I think game developers will love it if they have intelligent adaptive AI rivals. They don't need to develop new AI for each game. Maybe they just need to train AI in their own games.</p>
          <p>BYFORD: In the future, you will develop artificial intelligence that will be used primarily in medicine, smartphone assistants, and robots. In medicine, IBM's artificial intelligence Watson has made great progress in diagnosing cancer. What is DeepMind's goal?</p>
          <p>Hassabis: the development of DeepMind is still in its early stage. We've partnered with NHS, but we're just starting to develop a machine learning platform for medical applications. I think the goal of Watson is totally different from ours, and it is different from my understanding of AI. It's like an expert system. It's completely different from AI. I think you're going to see our AI diagnose the pictures medically, and then vertically track vital signs or quantify yourself to help people lead healthier lifestyles. I think that's very suitable for using reinforcement learning.</p>
          <h3>4.smartphone assistant should become more intelligent.</h3>
          <p>Beaford: let's talk about smartphone assistant again. I saw you show slides of the sci-fi romance "She" in your presentation. Is that your ultimate goal?</p>
          <p>Hassabis: I think she's just a mainstream view that's easy to get popular and accepted. We all think smartphone assistants should actually be smarter, more context-aware, and more in-depth understanding of what you're trying to do. At the same time, most of these systems are pre programmed. This means that once you get rid of preprogramming, they become totally useless. Therefore, we will develop more adaptable, flexible and powerful smart phone assistants.</p>
          <p>BYFORD: AlphaGo also started with a lot of game modes. How can it be used on smartphones with different input modes?</p>
          <p>Hassabis: There are countless related data that you can learn from. In fact, the AlphaGo algorithm will be the focus of our research and development in the coming months, and we think it can get rid of the initial supervised learning and enter the self-fulfilling learning mode. This can take longer, because it takes longer training, testing, and sometimes errors to play the game randomly. But we believe that this is a pure way of learning.</p>
          <p>Beford: can you make predictions that when people use smart phones, there will be significant progress?</p>
          <p>Hassabis: I think in the next 2 to 3 years, you will see great changes in smart phones. I mean, there will be very subtle changes in mobile phones, and some aspects will become better. Perhaps in 4 to 5 years, you will begin to see more changes in the performance of smart phones.</p>
          <h3>5.Google support is very important for AlphaGo.</h3>
          <p>BYFORD: You've identified all the possibilities for the future, and these are the most obvious links to Google's existence. Do you think this technology is applicable to Google products or business models?</p>
          <p>Hassabis: No, we have considerable autonomy in optimizing research progress. This is our mission and our intention to join Google. But it may take years. Of course, we're actually involved in many of Google's in-house product developments, but they're in the early stages, so it's not convenient to discuss them now. Smartphone assistants are a very central part, and I think Sundar Pichai has mentioned it many times and it's very important for Google's future.</p>
          <p>Beford: how important is Google's support for AlphaGo? Can you succeed without this support?</p>
          <p>Hassabis: Google's support is very important. AlphaGo hasn't actually been applied to hardware yet. We need a lot of hardware training for it. We also need to develop different versions so that they can compete against each other in the cloud. This may require a lot of hardware support to be effective, so we can't make progress in the short term without the resources provided by Google.</p>
          <h3>6.robots may help find new particles in the future.</h3>
          <p>BYFORD: When it comes to robots, I've been to Japan, a country that sees itself as the "spiritual home" of robots. I see that robots are used in two main ways in Japan: industrial robots made by companies such as Fanuc can do many amazing things for fixed targets. Softbank's Pepper, a concierge robot developed in some ways, is more ambitious but limited. What do you think of this situation?</p>
          <p>Hassabis: I think, as you said, Fanuc robots have very strong physical abilities, but they lack intelligence. Protocol robots are a bit like smartphone assistants, but they only answer fixed questions based on pre-programming. If you don't play cards properly, they will get into chaos.</p>
          <p>BYFORD: So I think the obvious problem is that technology like machine learning will improve robotics.</p>
          <p>Hassabis: This is just a completely different way. You're building new capabilities to learn new things and deal with accidents, and I think you need to apply robots or software to the real world to interact with real users, and they need to be able to do that and use it correctly. I think the learning path must be the right way.</p>
          <p>Beford: what do you think is the most direct application of learning robots?</p>
          <p>Hassabis: in fact, we haven't given much thought to this. Obviously, driverless cars are also robots, but they are only narrow AIs, although they use some of the functions of learning AI as computer vision. Tesla's computer vision technology is also based on deep learning. I believe that the same is true of Japanese geriatric care robots and household cleaning robots, and I think they will be very useful. Especially in the age of population aging, it will help relieve social pressure.</p>
          <p>Beford: why is learning AI so important?</p>
          <p>Hassabis: you must consider: why do we not have these things now? Why do we not have robots that can automatically clean houses? The reason is that the layout of each house, home and so on are not the same. Even in your own house, it's not the same everyday. Sometimes it's messy, sometimes it's neat. So you can't pre program the robot so that it can help you clean up your room. In addition, you need to take into account your personal preferences, such as how you like to fold clothes. In fact, it's a very complicated problem. It's easy for humans to do these things, but it's very complicated for robots.</p>
          <p>Beford: I want to know when we can get more advanced robots. Where is the critical point of a good enough robot?</p>
          <p>Hassabis: I think everyone can buy a reasonably priced robot that can help you clean dishes and clean the house. These beautiful vacuum cleaners are very popular, but they are not intelligent yet. Therefore, I think every improvement will lead to the birth of more advanced robots.</p>
          <p>Beford: what vision do you have for human beings, robots and artificial intelligence in the future?</p>
          <p>Hassabis: I didn't think much about robots. But I'm excited about the use of artificial intelligence in science, which can help science move faster. I'd like to see AI-assisted science, where you can effectively use AI assistants to help you do tedious work, find interesting articles, discover patterns in large amounts of data, and help human scientists break through faster. I think it would be cool if AI could be involved in the discovery of new particles in the future.</p>
