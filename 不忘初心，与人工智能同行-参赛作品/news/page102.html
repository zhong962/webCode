        <h1 class="title">Application of artificial intelligence in subdivision and emerging fields</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>It is an undeniable fact that artificial intelligence has been developing rapidly in the near future. Artificial intelligence technology has come a long way from assisting humans in mechanical operations to using cognitive intelligence to perform more complex tasks. Every day we encounter interesting applications based on artificial intelligence.</p>
          <p>The ability of deep learning algorithm in learning and prediction opens the door for the application of AI. Today, AI has also had a profound impact in other areas. In this article, we will discuss the application of AI in some areas of subdivision.</p>
          <p>In daily life or on the Internet, you must have met or heard a lot about artificial intelligence in applications such as autopilot, image processing (Prisma, Google Photos) and chatting robot. However, AI is also playing a major role in many other subdivision areas. These niche applications have not received much attention in the press, but they are very active in AI research publications. In this article, we will explore these areas of segmentation, so that you have a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of AI applications.</p>
          <h2>Astronomy</h2>
          <p>Astronomers deal with large amounts of data and signals. Analyzing and classifying these data is a difficult task. Now astronomers are using unsupervised machine learning to automate tasks that previously required thousands of volunteers.</p>
          <p>Alex Hocking, a graduate student at the University of Hertford, led a similar project, commenting: "The point of our algorithm is not to tell the machine what to look for in the image, but to teach it how to'see'."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1011.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>AI is helping astronomers make blurred and noisy images clearer. Researchers use neural networks to enhance existing data. The deployment of this machine learning algorithm does reduce the workload of humans and sometimes improve the quality of images. So what does Alex Hocking mean by teaching machines how to "see"?</p>
          <p>As more and more astronomers begin to use advanced machine learning techniques to analyze astronomical data, the future of astronomy looks brighter. With the advent of the era of outer space exploration, perhaps AI technology can help humans learn a habitable planet by analyzing images and signals in depth.</p>
          <h2>Construction and planning</h2>
          <p>Machine learning algorithm has been used to make the best building layout model to reduce energy consumption as much as possible. Machine learning-based energy models provide the best solution by analyzing historical and current data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1012.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Some buildings in Manhattan, New York, have been designed and built by using machine learning based energy models.</p>
          <p>In terms of energy efficiency, AI has been deployed to optimize the power grid of the entire city. Grid4c is a company that provides predictive analysis solutions for smart grid. Machine learning algorithms can analyze data from millions of smart meters. Combining these data with consumer behavior can provide a comprehensive solution for smart power transmission. This method can learn from user behavior and device usage. This will help the power supply bureau to understand the peak and trough of fine grained electricity consumption. Thus the power supply can be optimized through smart grid.</p>
          <h2>Agriculture</h2>
          <p>AI is entering the most traditional industry, agriculture. The purpose of using AI is to grow more crops with the same resources as before. This is where AI is helping farmers. Research based on AI is exploring various aspects of agriculture, the most significant areas of achievement include automatic intelligent irrigation and crop disease detection.</p>
          <p>Intelligent machine learning algorithm is helping farmers to achieve automatic irrigation and optimize irrigation. It reduces the waste of water resources and optimizes crop water supply. The AI driven system can analyze soil, weather and crop types to optimize water supply.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1013.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Plantix, a mobile app, is helping farmers use image recognition technology to detect plant diseases. It uses a large amount of image data to identify, prevent and treat. At present, the app can identify more than 60 kinds of plant diseases, and the accuracy rate is over 90%. As more image data are fed back to app, these two data indicators will also increase.</p>
          <h2>kinematic analysis</h2>
          <p>Today, athletes and coaches are using AI to seriously analyze their performance. The analysis of competitors is another important area that coaches and managers need to pay attention to. A large number of data can be captured, analyzed, and used to predict future performance. This is the role of machine learning in motion analysis.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1014.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>A large number of data sets, such as fitness, health status, strength, speed, ability, skills, match day conditions, make machine learning algorithm the best choice for motion analysis. These algorithms can help relevant personnel to predict the movement indicators of individuals or competitors. This is not only achieved by human cognitive ability, but by learning historical data and real-time analysis of movement.</p>
          <p>Iceberg is a company that uses AI technology to help ice hockey team analyze data. They claim to be able to provide 500 athletes with real-time accuracy of 0. seconds. Maybe AI can help us predict the result in the future. It's interesting to see how deep AI is in analyzing and predicting the statistics of teams or athletes.</p>
          <h2>Entertainment</h2>
          <p>In June 9, 2016, a short film called Sunspring was released. This is a movie created by Benjamin, an intelligent automatic playwright. Benjamin is trained with LSTM RNN. In addition to screenwriters, AI plays a role in directing, photography and other aspects of film production. For example, take a look at this trailer from IBM's Watson, called AI horror movie called Morgan. It is worth noting that AI has shortened the whole process of trailers from about 30 days to 24 hours.</p>
          <p>AI's application in the entertainment industry is not confined to films. The arts and music industry has gained inspiration from AI. 0music is a music album written entirely by Melomics 109, a computer program developed by the University of Malaga in Spain.</p>
          <p>As machine learning algorithms become more computational and cognitive, we will see more AI applications in the entertainment industry. Maybe in the coming years, AI can even replace musicians or photographers, but for the industry's top artists, AI's ability is clearly not up to that level. After all, AI has proved to be impossible to produce original ideas in the subjective field.</p>
          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>Educational data mining is a relatively new application of artificial intelligence in the field of education. Generally speaking, schools will choose a single model to teach students. This model has a drawback, because not every student has similar learning ability. In addition, it is difficult for teachers to seriously evaluate each student's performance.</p>
          <p>Now, machine learning algorithm can evaluate and analyze each student's respective performance. Students can learn through visual content, and each student's behavior can be tracked to analyze individual learning performance. Carnegie Learning and Thinkster Math are the two companies that use advanced analysis in the field of education.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1015.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Education can benefit from advanced machine algorithms that are out of classroom limitations. AI can help learners to conduct self direction, self-assessment, teamwork and so on. In addition, AI has promoted the emergence of collaborative learning platform. Collaborative learning platform Brainly is currently exploring the potential of AI to enhance social learning.</p>
          <h2>Marine protection</h2>
          <p>AI driven robots are currently being used to detect water pollution levels and track changes in ocean temperatures and pH values. These automated robots can collect large amounts of data from multiple geographic locations and then analyze and predict the data. In this way, action plans that restrict certain changes in the ecosystem can be implemented more accurately.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1016.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>AI has another important application in the protection of the oceans: controlling invasive marine animals. AI technology makes robots more accurate and efficient, and enables them to track and destroy invasive species by using machine learning and computer vision technology. It is noteworthy that this technique has been applied in practical applications, such as the elimination of lionfish in the Atlantic Ocean and thorny starfish in the Great Barrier Reef. Invasive species can lead to the extinction of native animals and plants, reduce biodiversity, compete with native organisms for limited resources, change habitats, and so on. When lionfish enter the Atlantic Ocean from its native Indian Ocean region, their population increases rapidly due to the lack of natural enemies. Thus endangering the local species in the Atlantic.</p>
          <p>AI has more updated applications in areas that have never been explored before. Health care relies on AI technology to get better diagnosis and prevention programs. Moreover, the logistics industry is focusing on the use of intelligent robots to achieve automated warehouses. Many industries can use AI technology.</p>
