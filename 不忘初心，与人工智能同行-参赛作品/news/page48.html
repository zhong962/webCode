        <h1 class="title">Simple search: let AI go solidly</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>New terminologies have emerged in the Internet, such as block chains, big data, cloud computing, and recently the hottest artificial intelligence. We have many science fiction movies in the image of robots, artificial intelligence based on the Alpha dog has swept the world of Go, defeated a lot of Go players. But these AI are still somewhat invisible. How does AI affect our lives?</p>
          <p>At the 2018 China international big data industry fair, Robin Li, the head of Baidu, mentioned a product that allows AI to serve hundreds of millions of users: simple search. Making all the user visible and touching artificial intelligence products has become a new direction for Baidu's development.</p>
          <p>Looking at the development of science and technology in the world, AI has come to an early stage. As early as 1956, Shannon and McCarthy had held a summit in Dartmouth to discuss artificial intelligence. By the 1980s, they were translating languages, interpreting images, and reasoning like humans, becoming the main direction of the development of artificial intelligence. By 1997, the famous Deep Blue computer had defeated the world's top chess player, Kasparov, and created the history of the world's artificial intelligence. After entering the 21st century, with the gradual breakthrough of big data, speech recognition, machine translation and other technologies, the practical application of artificial intelligence has gradually become possible. In recent years, many artificial intelligence has successfully passed the Turing test, and can deal with many complex problems. In 2012, artificial intelligence has been able to accurately identify cat images from 10 million unlabeled images using in-depth learning algorithms, thus having a real sense of "thinking ability". Simple Search pushes forward the visualization of artificial intelligence, that is to say, let people see, touch and use artificial intelligence, and become the real mission of simple search. Behind this is Baidu's attempt to make AI technology explicit - to embed AI technology into a simple search, so that search becomes the technology's edge, so that artificial intelligence as the search kernel, so that the "algorithm, computational power, big data" three elements of artificial intelligence throughout the search. For example, product photo recognition can not only read pictures and sweep codes, but also answer questions and translate. Intelligent automatic shooting function makes real-time display and translation possible at any time. From the perspective of human linguistics, the product allows voice search, allowing voice recognition of individuals, this different voice of different results, to ensure that children can get a healthy, pure, friendly and harmonious network environment. There are also "Leeds Dog" with block chain as the core and "Small Paradise" specially built for children, all of which shine with the brilliance of science and technology.</p>
          <p>This is an era of science and technology, scientific and technological innovation is quietly changing our lives, artificial intelligence is through voice, images, video barrier-free search from the technical background to the public foreground. Innovation is not limited to the laboratory, ivory tower, people can see the artificial intelligence, people can use the application of AI, is technology to make life better place. Artificial intelligence enables people to manipulate search by voice and liberate human hands with artificial intelligence. When we find that there are many ways to connect the world, innovation will bring more power to human life.</p>
