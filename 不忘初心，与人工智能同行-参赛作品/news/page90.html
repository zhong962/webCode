          <p>Probably from the March 2016 game of man-machine Go, there has been a domestic debate on artificial intelligence. Through in-depth study of the AI program AlphaGo, with a result of 4:1 to win the game with the world champion Go, professional nine-paragraph chess player Li Shishi. A year later, in May 2017, Alpha Go defeated Ke Jie, then the world's No. 1 Go champion, with three consecutive wins at the Wuzhen Weiqi Summit in China. But when people began to worry about the "harm" of artificial intelligence to humans, big health industry people saw the hope of AI enabling industry.</p>
          <p>Simply understand, "AI + Great Health" refers to the use of artificial intelligence, big data, Internet of Things, cloud computing and other new technologies and means in the medical service subject, medical institutions and medical service object and other large health fields. As an industry observer, Euro Health has witnessed too many AI surprises and changes in health care over the past two years.</p>
          <p>We are well aware that "AI + Great Health" is the mouthpiece of the entire industry, and in 2018 more and more players will be involved in the transformation of the technology leverage industry. In fact, not only are enterprises and capital scratching hands, eager to try, the national policy level is also "spring tide" surge. Among them, the most noteworthy is that the State Council in July 2017 issued the "New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" mentioned that we should continue to promote the application of new models and new means of artificial intelligence therapy, accelerate the establishment of a rapid and accurate intelligent medical system.</p>
          <p>Excited, we also wonder why AI has only one company in the landing scene of new drug development in China. So many players gathered in the "AI + assisted diagnosis" field, the industry's "shuffle" will be in what form? More and more businessmen began to consume the concept of "AI + fat loss", really let the fat reduction industry out of the cold winter zero point where? For investors, what kind of medical companies will laugh last? Which empowering mode can bring industry forward?</p>
          <p>These doubts are prompting us to constantly pursue and anticipate the brainstorming of the industry. To this end, billion euro will be held in Shanghai in June 15th, "smart + big health summit." We hope that this is a feast to witness industry change and stimulate industry thinking, it has both "AI + Big Health" excellent players, but also the participation of investors; in addition to hospital workers, but also dialogue with academic experts..</p>
          <p>We will invite the "AI + Assisted Diagnosis" field of head enterprises, due to the advantages of technology and the shortage of talent, this scenario will be a major breakthrough in intelligent health, but also the focus of the current industry. In this area, Presumption Technology, founded in 2016, has just completed a $300 million C round of financing in March this year, and launched a series of clinical applications of AI-DR, AI-CT, AI-Scholar products; in 2011, it was founded in 2017, and received $3.333 billion in financing, and it also released its own uCloud Intelligent Medical Cloud cloud, integrating the Internet and cloud computing. Advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, large data analysis and so on can realize cloud-based collaborative sharing of high-quality medical resources and the application of large-scale deep data mining at the diagnosis and treatment level.</p>
          <p>In addition, as "Healthy China" rises to the national strategic level, people are also paying more and more attention to individual health management, the "Smart + Great Health Summit" will naturally invite enterprises in this area. We note that Carbon Cloud Intelligence, founded in 2015, is favored by capital. In 2016, Carbon Cloud Intelligence completed 1 billion A rounds of financing and 300 million yuan of strategic financing. At present, Carbon Cloud Intelligence has also launched a health management product called "Look for Me"; Li Yuxin, founder of Healthy and Beneficial Team, spent three years leading Healthy and Beneficial Team to polish the Artificial At the technical level, the user retention has also attracted the market users of the company, such as HKUST, Baidu and other companies.</p>
          <p>The "smart + big health summit" will be held in Changning District, Shanghai. On the one hand, in October 2017, Shanghai G60 (Songjiang District) Dongjing Artificial Intelligence Industrial Base was recognized by the Torch Center of the Ministry of Science and Technology as the first national AI characteristic industrial base; on the other hand, on November 14, 2017, the Shanghai Municipal Government issued the "Opinions on Implementing the Development of New Generation Artificial Intelligence in this Municipality". It will strengthen the prospective layout of AI scientific research, promote the development of AI industrial agglomeration, and create a diversified and innovative ecosystem of AI.</p>
          <p>Chen Mingbo, director of Shanghai Economic and Information Commission, believes that data technology, human capital and infrastructure are the basic elements of the development of artificial intelligence, and Shanghai has a great advantage in this regard, striving to provide a model for China and the world. We believe that as a highly modernized international city, Shanghai, with its technology, talents and policies, will surely become the leading edge of AI's great potential for health. And the summit will also be a deep and unforgettable industry dialogue.</p>
