        <h1 class="title">What kind of artificial intelligence do we need?</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>After Lee Shi-shih, the world champion of Go in Korea, was defeated by artificial intelligence, many people began to worry about how human beings should compete against artificial intelligence, and what kind of artificial intelligence do we need? Nobel laureate Mo Yan answered a high school student's question about the impact of artificial intelligence on the world, humorously saying, "You have to study hard, the future is yours, not robots."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p351.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>More than a decade ago, the biggest impression of artificial intelligence should have been Hollywood blockbusters, but now it has accidentally entered our lives. Whether we adapt or not, it has been inseparable from our lives, and has made a major change in our work and life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p352.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>In his international best-selling book, A Brief History of the Future, Israeli historian Yuval Heraly made an astonishing prediction: "Artificial intelligence and biotechnology are reshaping the world, and mankind is facing a whole new topic. In the future, only one percent of the population will complete the next biological evolution, upgrade to new species, and the remaining 99 percent will be completely useless class!</p>
          <p>In the past, robots used to only replace manual labor, but now robots have begun to replace mental labor - Robots instead of manual driving, robots instead of manual express delivery, and even artificial intelligence calculations.</p>
          <p>We don't have to worry too much about becoming a useless class, because every revolution will eliminate some of the professionals and technicians, but on the contrary will bring a lot of employment opportunities. What we need to think about is how can we survive in the age of AI?</p>
          <p>What the future needs is certainly three kinds of abilities, the ability to get along with artificial intelligence, the ability to get along with people, and the ability to surpass artificial intelligence.</p>
          <h3>1.ability to get along with AI</h3>
          <p>The first is that we need to understand, improve, and develop artificial intelligence around the development needs of artificial intelligence, and use it to achieve progress in our work and life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p353.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <h3>2.ability to get along with others</h3>
          <p>The second ability is the need for interpersonal communication. At the present stage of development, communication between people is still irreplaceable. Even with the further development of artificial intelligence in the future, they still can not understand the inner world of human beings, so it is impossible to replace interpersonal communication.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p354.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <h3>3.beyond artificial intelligence</h3>
          <p>The third ability is the work that AI can't do, creativity and worldview.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p355.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Human creativity is endless, artificial intelligence is the era of human creation, we use it to recognize the future, to change our lives and career. In the future, pipelining, programming, and data will be replaced by artificial intelligence, but there is no need to panic. In the past five years and ten years, emerging industries, which are most demanding in the market, are no longer looking back. But jobs that require creativity and humanism will not be replaced, and the skills required for those jobs will be irreplaceable.</p>
