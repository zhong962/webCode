        <h1 class="title">Wu Enda: AI helps employees get higher salaries instead of letting them lose their jobs</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>AI's landing application is to create more advanced forms of work, trained employees can get higher wages, can engage in more advanced labor methods. -- Wu Enda</p>
          <p>Wu Enda was the chief scientist of Baidu and one of the most authoritative scholars in the field of artificial intelligence. He left Baidu in March to start his own business. In June, he announced DeepLearning. ai, the first venture to focus on in-depth online education, and this time he announced Landing. ai, the second venture. In an interview with reporters, Wu Enda also revealed that third projects will be announced next year.</p>
          <p>The reason for creating Landing.ai is that Wu Enda believes that traditional industries are more difficult to enter the AI era than IT companies. As for the first entry into manufacturing, Wu explained that manufacturing is shaping the physical world, a more closely related industry to human life, and manufacturing faces a variety of problems that can be better solved through AI.</p>
          <p>The most important thing for AI to change from scientific research to practical application is to use AI to activate the vitality of the enterprise, how to make the enterprise operate better, not to make people lose their jobs. "The AI landing application is to create more advanced forms of work, trained employees can get higher wages, can engage in more advanced labor methods." Wu Enda said.</p>

        <div class="two">
          <h3>Reporter: why create Landing.ai?</h3>
          <p>Wu Enda: I wanted to help companies transform to apply AI. Everyone knows that I led the Google Brain team earlier and then Baidu AI. During this period I began to realize how AI changed a company and demonstrated its products, services and performance to users. AI has great potential and has been playing a role in the IT field before, and then I hope it can be applied to people's basic life, including health, accommodation, diet and so on, which can be better through the application of AI to society and other industries.</p>
          <p>In the field of AI transformation is very easy, but the resources of AI transformation are hard to find. Landing. AI has been planning since July this year to help other companies transform into AI, and we decided to start with manufacturing. IT companies focus on technology competition, but traditional industries are affected by more factors, so we use AI to help traditional enterprises transform. We are setting up some medium and long-term assistance companies to help companies better apply AI.</p>
          <h3>Reporter: Why did you choose to cut into the manufacturing industry first? What is the short-term goal of Landing.ai?</h3>
          <p>Wu Enda: Now there are many industries that can transform AI and apply AI, and there are several reasons why we choose manufacturing to start with. First of all, I think IT is doing a good job of shaping the digital media industry, and manufacturing is shaping the physical world, an industry that is more closely related to human life. Looking around, especially in the office, you'll find that a lot of things are made around us, and I think choosing manufacturing is an important shift from the electronic world to the real world.</p>
          <p>In addition, when it comes to manufacturing, there are a lot of problems, such as product quality problems, production lines, etc. can be better solved through AI. Since July, Landing. AI has been working with manufacturers to find ways to solve these problems.</p>
          <p>If you look at it, many big companies, such as Baidu, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, have done a good job developing AI. Applying AI can not only achieve one goal, but also do a lot of things at the same time. I think this applies to manufacturing, which will greatly improve the quality of products.</p>
          <h3>Reporter: You mentioned in your open letter that Landing. AI will focus on developing vocational training. Will this part be achieved by DeepLearning. ai?</h3>
          <p>Wu Enda: First of all, Deeplearing. AI has its own curriculum, and the original intention of establishing DeepLearning. AI is to enable people with basic programming knowledge to learn in-depth learning content, is a relatively basic thing. But when it comes to manufacturing, there's a lot of terminology, and the people involved need to constantly learn new knowledge, and the engineers need to learn, so that they can solve more problems. As a result, skills training in Landing.ai tends to be more coursera-oriented and more professional.</p>
          <h3>Reporter: about DeepLearing.ai, what is the next development plan?</h3>
          <p>Wu Enda: Some people might be curious about what I'm going to do next. I did DeepLearning. ai, coursera, and now I'm the CEO of Landing. ai. I'll spend more time on Landing. ai. As for DeepLearning. ai's next step, we want to expand our training to allow more people to learn about AI. I will seriously help more people to contact AI, and then we will publish more courses on coursera.</p>
          <h3>Reporter: what is the most difficult thing for AI to turn from scientific research to practical application?</h3>
          <p>Wu Enda: It's hard to say. The most important thing for Landing. AI is technology landing. It's very complicated. It requires us to have a very deep understanding of manufacturing and AI industries. We need to accumulate enough technology to solve the problems in manufacturing transformation.</p>
          <p>In short, what we do is to activate the vitality of the enterprise, how to make the enterprise better operation, not let people lose their jobs. In fact, AI landing applications, especially the integration of AI into manufacturing, create more advanced forms of work, where trained employees are paid more and can engage in more advanced forms of work. I believe that the development of the manufacturing industry in the future will create more job opportunities.</p>
          <h3>Reporter: how do you think you can really integrate AI into corporate culture?</h3>
          <p>Wu Enda: Culture is complex, but workflow and process are simple. We start from this point of view. It's important to keep learning and keep learning. The process of Landing. AI is the process of learning. We're happy to help partners learn AI.</p>
