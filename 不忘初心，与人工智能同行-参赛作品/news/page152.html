          <p>For many people, the UAV is just a novelty gadget, an interesting toy that can fly around, take aerial images, and even monitor neighbors. With the popularity of UAVs, UAVs have been used in a variety of situations, far beyond their use as robotic toys.</p>
          <p>In just a few years, UAVs have intensified and redefined various industries. They are used for transporting goods quickly, studying the environment extensively and scanning remote military bases. UAV has been used for safety monitoring, security inspection, border monitoring and storm tracking. In military attacks, they are even equipped with missiles and bombs to protect the lives of troops, otherwise they will be required to enter these combat areas.</p>

          <p>Now, the whole company is providing UAV for commercial purposes. The potential of these remote control flying robots is unlimited.</p>
          <p>"Data captured by UAVs is an innovative solution that provides stakeholders with complex analytical data and an affordable way to improve workplace assessment, design, progress tracking and reporting," wrote Patrick Perry of the UAV base in a blog post.</p>
          <p>The next generation of UAVs is still constrained by human controllers and will be powered by AI. AI can make decisions such as UAVs and other machines, and operate as human controllers. But when a machine is capable of making decisions and "learning" independently of human function, it must take into account the potential benefits that can be harmful to society as a whole.</p>

          <p>When it comes to artificial intelligence, we're entering an unknown field, and the only guide is our imagination. In the past century, some of the smartest people have been predicting what will happen in the future. Can we face a world in which a group of semi-robots like Terminator would send the world into a nuclear catastrophe?</p>
          <p>For many, the threat of automatic robots is nothing more than a fiction by Isaac Asimov, an early American science fiction writer. After all, I am not just a popular Smith action movie. Between 1940 and 1950, Asimov published a series of short stories depicting future interactions between humans and robots.</p>

          <p>Earlier this year, roboticists from Carnegie Mellon University published a paper entitled Learning to Fly in a Crash. The study explored the testing of AR Drone 2.0 by roboticists who guided themselves through trials and errors in 20 different indoor environments. In just 40 hours of flight time, the UAV controlled the air environment through 11,500 collisions and corrections.</p>
          <p>"We built an unmanned aerial vehicle with the sole purpose of hitting objects," the researchers wrote. "We use all these negative flight data, combined with positive data from the same trajectory, to learn a simple and powerful UAV navigation policy." Russell also spoke highly of the potential and practical benefits of AI. Recently, Intel has used the technology to gather video and other data about wildlife to help scientists do important research more effectively and less.</p>
          <p>"Artificial intelligence will help us tackle some of the most daunting challenges and accelerate solutions to large-scale problems, including the release of new scientific discoveries," Naveen Rao, vice president and general manager of Intel Artificial Intelligence Products, said in a statement.</p>
          <p>Similarly, General Electric subsidiary Avitas Systems has begun deploying unmanned aerial vehicles to automate inspections of infrastructure, including pipelines, transmission lines and transportation systems. Artificial intelligence UAVs can not only perform surveillance safely and efficiently, but also recognize abnormal situations in data instantly by their machine learning technology.</p>
