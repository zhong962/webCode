        <div class="two">
          <p>When the owner comes home, the lights automatically turn on and the room temperature adjusts to the right temperature; while a small housekeeper like Siri will tell you which households to buy and the steps won't bother you, Siri will go online and order; when you go out, your car will be able to drive perfectly automatically, fundamentally Do not worry about road conditions and road recognition.</p>
          <p>Do you think you can play like this? The best is yet to come.</p>
          <p>If you do something illegal in the course of driving, Siri is absolutely unwilling to remind you in time.</p>
          <p>You must think this is my fantasy scene, in fact, it is not, this is just released a few days ago, foreign science fiction thriller "upgrade" scene. But maybe it will soon be reflected in our real life scene.</p>
          <h3>On the surface of the smart speaker market, the situation is excellent.</h3>
          <p>In the current global artificial intelligence wave, intelligent speakers as a new human-computer interaction experience of the best entrance, has become the world's technological giants to open the door to AI a breakthrough. Amazon Alexa is still leading the smartphone market, followed by Google, while Apple Siri and Microsoft Cortana are still in the chase. Amazon has sold more than 50 million Alexa smart speakers worldwide in the wake of the wave and hopes to integrate its products with smart speakers, according to TechWeb on August 7.</p>
          <p>Back home, with the increasing support of BAT and the full distribution of other Internet unicorns, the smart speaker Market in China has also ushered in an unprecedented rapid development. According to Canalys's latest statistics, in the second quarter of 2018, China's smart speaker market share is very strong, which can be seen in Google first, Amazon second, Tiancat elves third, millet fourth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1111.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>It is worth mentioning that millet, as a mobile phone manufacturer of the post-homicide Internet, with the "high cost-effective" and "explosive" model quickly break through layers of defense into many fields to establish a strong ecological system of millet, intelligent speaker is one of the brilliant.</p>
          <p>From last year to now, Zanu has 12.2% share of the whole market. We can see Xiao Ai students are very popular in the domestic market with a very low price. Unlike other manufacturers, millet lowers the threshold of smart speakers, and opens up the voice assistants of millet mobile phones, using in-depth learning algorithm, to achieve good performance. And in the past 15 days, Lei Jun announced Xiao Ai classmates more than 30 million monthly active equipment, which is the best news millet has heard since the IPO.</p>
          <p>This shows that both abroad and at home, the smart speaker Market as a whole seems to be doing well, the situation is very good. But is this really the case?</p>
          <h3>The controllability of intelligent voice is worth worrying.</h3>
          <p>The world's giants are scrambling for the super entrance to AI for smart speakers, but that doesn't mean the entrance is mature enough, just that the giants don't want to miss the best entrance. In fact, the intelligent speaker is only a carrier, the core of which is the intelligent voice interaction system (i.e. speech recognition). Speech recognition, as an important basis of AI research, can not achieve the technical level of pure semantic understanding and recognition accuracy, especially after carrying the intelligent speaker. The control of sound is worth worrying about.</p>
          <p>Although considering the global voice market competition, according to the latest foreign media news, Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Porta two voice assistants officially married. But it may still be unable to achieve its desired perfect form, such as the inability to play some online music services.</p>
          <p>That's not the point. The point is that you can't control your voice. Simply put, you don't know when you'll inadvertently wake up siri, or when your conversation will be eavesdropped on, and when the courier boy suddenly sends you a package, you'll still be confused.</p>
          <p>According to the author in Lei Feng net learned that a wonderful news happened abroad, Amazon Echo helped the police to avoid a murder. When a foreign man quarreled with his girlfriend, he pointed a gun at her and asked her, "Did you call the sheriff?" Next to it, Google Home hears the order to "call the sheriff" and executes it. Finally, the SWAT team arrived at the location of the incident, which prevented the further occurrence of the incident.</p>
          <p>This seems to be a good thing, at least Echo can help you solve the sudden danger and situation. But the next case will have to make you love and even horror.</p>
          <p>It is said that a foreign doll company has broadcast an advertisement for a doll house on TV. Several Amazon Echo families in the region have automatically started ordering doll homes online after hearing the advertisement. Not to mention, the Intelligent Systems Safety Laboratory of the School of Electrical Engineering of Zhejiang University has even successfully launched a "dolphin attack" on Amazon's speaker Echo. By exploiting the hardware vulnerabilities of the microphone, it has successfully "black" into the voice assistant system of intelligent devices, and by sending out ultrasonic sounds that can not be heard by the human ear. Voice assistants execute their instructions, such as letting Echo buy something on Amazon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1112.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Even more frightening, researchers at MWR InfoSecurity found a security hole in the old Amazon Echo smart speakers that hackers could turn into eavesdroppers without affecting its overall effectiveness. The principle is that the researchers connect the Echo to the notebook computer and the SD card reader through a plug made. Then debug the tool to crack the Echo system and write a special boot loader. All the audio streams the Echo hears are automatically forwarded to his remote server, and the key thing is that the other features of the smart speaker seem to be working.</p>
          <p>That is, if the smart speaker is invaded by illegal hackers, the user's massive data and privacy security will be greatly threatened.</p>
          <h3>Spoken language is still a barrier to speech recognition.</h3>
          <p>Going back to the accuracy of language awareness, despite the ongoing global breakthroughs in AI technology, speech recognition accuracy and comprehension have reached perfection levels, such as media reports that Google Assistant will support more than 30 languages by the end of 2018; in addition, Qualcomm has developed. A speech recognition device that recognizes words and phrases has an accuracy of up to 95%.</p>
          <p>But if this is used in Chinese testing, it may be very Low. As we all know, after thousands of years of cultural change in China, its writing has become elusive, especially the evolution of a strong variety of local characteristics of the language has already exceeded 30, even the Chinese people are not necessarily able to understand, let alone the lack of vitality of machine speech recognition.</p>
          <p>For example, in one study, people identified non-native spoken languages through the Alexa test, and the results showed that the inaccuracy rate was as high as 30%. Faced with Spanish and Chinese as the first language spoken in English, whether it is Google Home or Amazon Echo, its recognition rate is low and frightening.</p>
          <h3Write to the end</h3>
          <p>In short, speech recognition still seems to have many barriers that can not be overcome in a short time. The giants are taking a huge chunk of the smart speaker market just because it serves as the best solution to the bedroom link AI. While the giants have grabbed the entrance, it does not mean that he has mastered AI's super entrance. It still requires constant research and breakthroughs in speech recognition technology upgrading and innovation.</p>
          <p>Otherwise, even if you first seize the super entrance of the smart speaker, but in the process of the upgrade of the smart speaker, you will still be easily overtaken and replaced by the later, after all, AI as a highly innovative area of technology, only continuous technological innovation and iterative upgrade, it is possible to safely pass through. This upgrade war, as to whether it can become the benchmark of the industry, at least first survive.</p>
