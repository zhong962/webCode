        <div class="two">
          <p>"Today, with the rapid development of science and technology, artificial intelligence has become one of the key points for countries to participate in the global economic development and competition." Speaking of the influence of artificial intelligence, Xue Lan, Dean of the School of Public Administration of Tsinghua University, said frankly that "it is concerned by all mankind".</p>
          <p>Xue Lan explained that artificial intelligence technology is widely used in all walks of life, different countries have different development requirements. China's Artificial Intelligence Program covers four major areas: medical care, smart cities, unmanned driving and speech recognition.</p>
          <p>In his view, AI is providing convenience for human society, and it also hides unknown challenges.</p>
          <p>"The impact of technology on society is delayed." Xue Lan said: "For example, the previous industrial revolutions caused carbon dioxide emissions, hundreds of years later today we found the impact. Therefore, we should pay more attention and consideration to the development of AI.</p>
          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a program similar to human intelligence developed by computer scientists in the world since the 1950s. It represents the most influential technological revolution. It challenges the traditional mode of production and economic relations in depth, and it also extensively changes the daily behavior and social life of modern people.</p>
          <p>In the era of artificial intelligence, mankind's established cognitive system, values, lifestyle, moral laws and regulations, decision-making mechanisms are facing unprecedented crises and challenges, which requires a new concept and form of governance. Huang Xing, chairman of State Machine Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd.</p>

        <div class="two">
          <p>In July this year, the China Science and Technology Policy Research Center of Tsinghua University released the China Artificial Intelligence Development Report 2018. According to the report, China has become the largest country with the largest number of artificial intelligence patents in the world. In 2017, China's artificial intelligence market reached 23.7 billion yuan (RMB), an increase of 67%, and the number of artificial intelligence enterprises reached 1011, second only to 2028 in the United States.</p>
          <p>"If we do not control it and let it develop, the disaster it brings will be immeasurable. It is suggested that relevant organizations should legislate on a global scale to standardize the development and trend of the AI market. Huang Xing said.</p>
          <p>Zhang Yongwei, deputy director of the Enterprise Institute of the Development Research Center of the State Council, said that with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, how to make regulation and supervision keep up with the pace of innovation is something we need to think about. "This requires us to pay attention to the coordination of system and industry, and strengthen external supervision."</p>
          <p>On the same day, the participants also discussed discussions on "ecological civilization construction", "one belt along the road" and "open development", "medical insurance reform, aging and health care services", and discussed ways of sustainable development in the field of public management.</p>
          <p>The High Level Forum on Public Administration of Tsinghua University was founded in 2006. It is a platform for discussion on linking public administration education of Tsinghua University with local governments, promoting the combination of theory and practice, and serving local economic and social development. The main purpose is to provide reform proposals and ideas for innovating social governance and upgrading the modernization level of local governance through the exchange of frontier theories, policy dynamics and practical trends in the field of public management.</p>
