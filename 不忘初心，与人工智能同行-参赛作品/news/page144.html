          <p>A few years ago, in the American sci-fi blockbuster Prometheus, when could artificial intelligence participate in the operation process, despite the fact that many viewers were impressed by the fact that an automatic surgical robot operated on a female host? Regardless of Europe, America, Japan or China, the government and enterprises are actively promoting the landing of precision medicine at different levels. The well-known domestic product brand Hisense has been ploughing for many years.</p>
          <p>Hisense Medical organized an open day last year. The CAS computer-assisted surgical system, which uses CT or magnetic resonance data to reconstruct the fine anatomy of the target organs and assist doctors in surgery, has become a bright spot. Haixin Computer Assisted Surgery System has been used in more than 30 third-class hospitals in China, such as Tsinghua Changgeng Hospital, Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital and Qingdao University Affiliated Hospital. More than 1000 operations have been completed.</p>

          <img src="./pimg/p1432.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>At the medical industry conference held in Shanghai, Hisense brought a precise digital surgical solution based on artificial intelligence. When it comes to the development of this system, it is necessary for the field of pediatric surgery to be extremely elaborate. Professor Dong Xinran of the Pediatric Hospital of Fudan University introduced four cases of the world's leading super-difficult segregation of conjoined infants, and also let us appreciate the beauty of the combination of computer technology and medicine.</p>
          <p>In my opinion, there are the following important innovations:</p>
          <p>1. automatic blood vessel generation system. As all doctors know, the biggest difficulty in large-scale surgery such as tumor resection and system reconstruction is bleeding during surgery, which is the key to successful surgery.</p>
          <p>Through a large number of three-dimensional reconstruction of imaging film, the patient's blood vessels can be automatically generated by the algorithm, excluding other tissues and organs of the "noise interference", very clearly displayed, and then can be printed in 3D for preoperative simulation and discussion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1433.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>2. judgement of tumor boundary. This is directly related to tumor resection rate and prognosis, which is a very important practical problem.</p>
          <p>If the surgeon does not resect enough to cause partial residual, then tumor recurrence is a high probability event; but if the important organs are removed too much because of unclear, it will seriously affect functional compensation, increase the probability of massive bleeding, and make the prognosis of patients poor. This latest set of surgical solutions provided by Hisense Medical uses artificial intelligence algorithms to automatically determine tumor boundaries and actual organs, and then to determine the extent of tumor resection and program formulation. In addition, I see a particularly interesting word - "drainage basin" - that is, according to the "important blood vessel flow area" operation, the system can refer to a large number of previously completed surgery database, the computer automatically designed surgery program, to provide diagnostic advice for doctors. According to the statistical analysis and reports of the Haixin medical operation system since its birth more than one year ago, after the application of the system, the tumor resection rate has increased by 7%, 34% of the surgical schemes have been corrected more accurately and better, and the blood transfusion rate has been reduced by more than 20%.</p>
          <p>In addition, this digital surgical solution integrates the data of vital organs such as liver and lung involved in the operation, and builds a large-scale digital organ database, which will be of great help to medical teaching, clinical practice and scientific research analysis in the future. With this core technology as the carrier, providing teleconsultation and surgical guidance services in the medical community can not only improve the clinical level of doctors at the grass-roots level, but also directly benefit patients.</p>
          <p>3. in developing navigation system. Although not yet mature, today's special mention can be applied to pulmonary small lesions biopsy and difficult surgical process guidance, in theory can be done while the imaging system for intelligent analysis, accurate intraoperative navigation, greatly improve the success rate of surgery and reduce medical accidents.</p>
          <p>But I think the story is just the beginning. According to Dr. Chen Yongjian, an executive of Hitachi's core medical technology, the design of intelligent surgical system has become more and more perfect after continuous machine learning.</p>
          <p>Let's imagine that there are now superb surgical robots like Leonardo Da Vinci - more stable, calmer, and even more sophisticated than humans (previous screenbrushing with scalpels to peel grapes and crayfish videos is a dazzle), so, while doctors are now operating robots, the future will be Machine learning and artificial intelligence technology go a step further. Before surgery, the computer can automatically design the operation plan according to the comprehensive data and image reconstruction, and even can simulate training several times before surgery. Industrial automation design combined with artificial intelligence, let the robot operate independently throughout the whole process, and cooperate with intraoperative navigation system, real-time dynamic feedback, constantly make the operation more perfect. Doctors are not required to participate in the entire operation, but each step, each blood vessel separation and organ suture can be more perfect, can greatly reduce the level of doctors or operational errors, emotional instability and other risks of surgery.</p>
          <p>Complex surgery can do this, so simple surgery can be more fluid to "liberate" the doctor, which is likely to bring about a new subversion.</p>
          <p>In fact, medicine has always been a technology driven area. For example, stethoscope allows us to identify more diseases, B-ultrasound X-ray electrocardiogram and CT inventions, let us greatly improve the diagnostic ability; for example, a variety of new drugs and new equipment to solve the pain of a large number of patients. Without these constant technological advances and clinical integration, it won't be helpful even if you're face-to-face with the patient every day. When fully automated surgical robots surpass ordinary doctors from diagnosis to treatment without making mistakes, the impact on the entire health care system is revolutionary, just as alpha dogs have won a battle against all the world's best Go players.</p>
