        <div class="two">
          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, created by Google's DeepMind Health, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Trust and the University College of London's Institute of Ophthalmology, can recommend treatments for more than 50 eye diseases with an accuracy of 94%, comparable to that of top human experts, according to VentureBeat.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>In a study published online in the Journal Nature Medicine, researchers detailed the progress made by AI in the treatment of eye diseases. The Financial Times reported for the first time in February 2016 that AI could be used to analyze the largest eye diseases in retinal scans (such as glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy) and may be more accurate than trained human experts.</p>
          <p>Neural networks trained to detect patterns in images are also used to detect cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and kidney disease. Dr. Pearse Keane, a scientist at University College London, said: "The AI technology we are developing is designed to give priority to patients who need emergency treatment from doctors or ophthalmologists. If we can diagnose and treat eye diseases early, we have the best chance to save people's vision.</p>
          <p>Through further research, this may lead to higher quality of care for patients with eye diseases in the future. The system can not only give treatment advice, but also explain why doctors choose to make specific recommendations, and show a level of confidence in the recommended treatment process. The idea of sharing the fundamentals behind the proposals echoes that of Jeff Dean, Google's AI director, who wants to see more similar attempts. AI can also be deployed on a variety of medical imaging devices that can be used to generate medical images of the eye.</p>
          <p>However, the AI system must undergo clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval before it can be used for routine eye scans. A spokesman for DeepMind said Moorfields would be able to use the AI system free of charge in 30 hospitals and community clinics in the UK for an initial period of five years if clinical trials were successful.</p>
          <p>In recent years, with the rise of machine intelligence, the AI being developed (such as DeepMind and systems developed by partners) has often been advocated as a democratized AI that provides patients with the benefits of highly accurate algorithms. According to WHO statistics, more than 250 million people worldwide suffer from visual impairment or blindness. The eyes may be the windows of the mind, but they may also be the windows of more serious diseases. For example, diabetic retinopathy is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
          <p>The neural network created by Google can predict with about 70 percent accuracy whether patients with diabetic retinopathy will continue to experience major heart events such as heart attacks. This spring, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Google Medical Brain said the company had created an AI system that predicted whether patients would be admitted again. The results, published in June, also found that the AI system was able to predict whether patients would die during hospitalization, with an accuracy of more than 90 percent in both hospitals.</p>
          <p>Verily Life Sciences, a subsidiary of Alphabet, has also been active this year to address problems such as sleep apnea testing, use of AI to help drug discovery, blood collection, and health insurance.</p>
