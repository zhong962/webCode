        <h1 class="title">Hong Xiaowen: next ten years, AI application will become a battleground for the military.</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>"When Microsoft Research Institute was established 25 years ago, AI is already our strategic goal."</p>
          <p>After 22 years at Microsoft and 10 years as president of Microsoft Research Asia, Hong Xiaowen has become one of the people most familiar with the technology giant. In the past 25 years, the big coffee from Microsoft has occupied half of China's technology circle. Today, in an era of unprecedented popularity of artificial intelligence, many people have become the "chief scientist", "CTO" or even "president" of technology enterprises, leading the technological frontier of these enterprises. However, Microsoft's vision of artificial intelligence has continued, as big as "letting everyone have their own computers".</p>
          <p>Hong Xiaowen said that in the dialog world envisaged by Microsoft, chat robot (Xiao Bing) is a new application, intelligent assistant (Xiao Na) is a meta-application or a new browser, every conversation of users will inject intelligence. Except for Microsoft's own applications such as Office 365, Dynamics 365, MileIQ, SwiftKey, Microsoft is injecting all of its applications into artificial intelligence, from smart assistants to applications to services to providing infrastructure (Azure cloud platform). To put it simply, it is to popularize AI and open platform to developers.</p>
          <p>Hong Xiaowen believes that the future of artificial intelligence in the two major directions of development, wisdom and emotion, both Microsoft will be involved in the simultaneous development of IQ and EQ. In the face of the tremendous impact of AI on human work and life and the ensuing ethical issues, Dr. Hong Xiaowen said that rules must be made to regulate AI development. It is reported that Microsoft has developed a series of AI core design principles to ensure that the development of this technology is transparent and safe, for the protection of privacy to set the highest standards, while inclusive and respectful of all. In Hong Xiaowen's view, human beings and machines have their own unique characteristics and skills. The former possesses creativity, empathy, and emotion; the latter possesses the power of AI computing to process vast amounts of data and discover complex patterns from it. Once the two are effectively integrated, there will be many wonderful things to happen.</p>

          <h3>Reporter: Some people worry about the arrival of strong artificial intelligence, that is, artificial intelligence over and rule over mankind, do you think this day will come?</h3>
          <p>Hong Xiaowen: As a scientist and a member of a technology company, I think the first thing to explain to you is that AI is not so godly. Like other machines, it is still controlled by human beings. Moreover, at present, people do not know much about themselves. We still have a long way to go from strong AI. At the same time, the development of AI will have a disruptive impact on the current workplace, people's work/life habits, which requires more thinking and standardization in our education and data management, and requires the IT community to explore with the government, international and various fields.</p>
          <p>From now on, the development of artificial intelligence has gone through three stages: computational intelligence, perceptual intelligence and cognitive intelligence. The first level of intelligence is the improvement of computing power, and the next level is perception, that is, the recognition of speech, image and other aspects of the machine. The next level is cognition, which includes the computer's ability to understand speech and image, and the naturalness of interaction with users. AI is still at the level of perception, such as computer recognition and computer speech.</p>
          <h3>Reporter: when can we reach the stage of cognitive intelligence?</h3>
          <p>Hong Xiaowen: it takes some time for AI to achieve real cognition. For example, in today's more desirable environments, speech recognition is more than 95 percent accurate, almost as good as human recognition, and Microsoft first succeeded in bringing machines to the level of human professional stenographers in October 2016. However, there are still some problems to be solved in the field of speech recognition. When the computer is in a noisy environment, or the microphone radio effect is weak, the recognition accuracy will be greatly reduced.</p>
          <p>A problem known as the cocktail party effect can describe this situation very well. If we're attending a cocktail party and talking to seven or eight people at the same time, then if we want to listen mainly to one person, we humans can automatically filter out the other person's speech and focus our attention on what that person is saying. But when a computer is in this environment, it is still very difficult to identify a particular person's voice and recognize it when there are multiple voices intertwined.</p>
          <h3>Reporter: what is the impact of AI on the future?</h3>
          <p>Hong Xiaowen: Looking to the future, the technology that artificial intelligence is most likely to produce geometric series chains is likely to be the driving force of the new industrial revolution, but also has a great chance to become the cornerstone of the next generation of intelligent Internet.</p>
          <p>A few days ago, the Prime Minister issued a report on the work of the government pointed out that to speed up the cultivation and expansion of new industries, including artificial intelligence, "artificial intelligence" was written in the national government work report for the first time. Artificial intelligence has become a top priority in China's political, economic and academic fields. This is the best era for Chinese AI people, and China's AI will usher in a truly new era.</p>
          <h3>Reporter: what do you think of the future development of AI? Will there be revolutionary progress in technology and application? What is Microsoft's plan for AI?</h3>
          <p>Hong Xiaowen: Microsoft is committed to popularizing artificial intelligence, hoping that everyone can use it and benefit from it. We focus on creating an artificial intelligence cluster that not only covers infrastructure, services, applications, and intelligent assistants, but also can be used by a wide range of customers, including consumers, enterprise users and developers.</p>
          <p>In the future, artificial intelligence has two main directions: one is wisdom, the other is emotion. Today no one knows what kind of Chatbots do we like. So Microsoft will allow these two lines to do more exploration, rather than making choices too early. The most ideal development model of artificial intelligence is to develop IQ and EQ simultaneously, which have sensory ability, can recognize images, words, voices, and emotions, so as to establish a good and lasting relationship with users.</p>
          <p>For example, the future direction of search transformation is artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence will overturn the form of search, so that the search box and social network point-to-point interaction mode become a thing of the past. Just like asking a friend for advice, when you talk to an AI assistant, it will naturally give you the information you want. The human-machine interaction of this dialogue is not only a new way of searching, but also a new business mode.</p>
          <p>For example, Microsoft and Jingdong cooperate to import Jingdong's product data into Xiaobing background. When a girl chats with Xiao Bing, she may talk about a Korean star, and then talks about taking pictures on her mobile phone, which one is better for taking pictures. Xiao Bing can talk with her about the cost-effectiveness of her mobile phone, which phone is good for taking photos and so on. On the second day, the girl really listened to Xiaobing's advice and bought a cell phone from Jingdong.</p>
          <p>For example, with the cooperation of Weixin Public Signal, Xiao Bing moved into the Public Signal, there is a natural language interface. Xiao Bing can push the content of the public number according to your search request, and share the rich information about the public number with you. We find that through such natural language communication, the click rate is particularly high. In fact, each search requirement is not independent, and keyword search can only reflect the fragments of human thinking. We want search to be more like a conversation between people: this is likely to be the next transformation in search.</p>
          <h3>Reporter: You have been leading Microsoft Research Institute for Asia for ten years. In these two years, artificial intelligence has reached the hottest era. How do you think about the development of the Research Institute in the next ten years?</h3>
          <p>Hong Xiaowen: AI is definitely the future. It takes some time to really do a good job of a product and service that can serve our ecosphere and our users. The direction and goals we have set for AI research in the past two years will continue to move forward this year. I think it can be divided into the following aspects.</p>
          <p>First of all, we will have some AI applications developed by ourselves, to provide services to customers, such as Xiao Bing is a chat robot, and Xiao Na is an intelligent assistant, not only we, some other industry enterprises, also have done, this is absolutely a battleground, but also the customer needs. And the application scenarios aren't limited to the phones that people thought of at the beginning, but also to other devices, such as personal computers, and so on. A lot of times we're sitting in the office and the phone may be in another room, and you can't say I'm looking for my smart assistant and I have to pick it up first. This smart assistant should be ubiquitous, and some of your previous usage history must remember that only in this way can you get the best service. An important piece.</p>
          <p>This piece has evolved into another ecosphere, not only with our services, but also with how third-party services are brought in, which is a key point for us. Because most of Microsoft's products are platform-based products that are used through our partners, from Windows, Office to today's cloud platform (we call it Smart Cloud Platform), especially.</p>
          <p>We're doing this to make AI popular. I think people's coverage of AI is often about how powerful AI is. It's like people are competing with AI and we're going to lose to it. It's frustrating. But let's not forget that all the technology is designed to benefit humans, and that AI is really built. The premise of blessing mankind is to popularize AI.</p>
          <p>It's hard to popularize AI by Microsoft alone. We have to rely on our huge ecosphere to let our developers, developers willing to use Microsoft platform, everyone can do AI in their own products. Only in this way can AI produce the greatest effect. This is also us. The biggest goal of doing APIs, and when AI becomes popular, people won't be afraid, as if nobody is talking about the mobile Internet now.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, AI technology has a long way to go and no chance to compare with human intelligence. For example, emotions, human studies of AI have so far done very little in terms of emotions, Xiao Bing is the first large-scale attempt to communicate with people emotionally, can be said to be rare. Looking forward to 2017, we will continue to do research on emotion. Today you see that this chat robot doesn't seem to have any practical use, but if we can do more research, I believe that the AI-based intelligent assistants mentioned above will be able to provide more effective services to humans in the future, because emotions are very important, and humans can only accept them smoothly if they are happy and convinced. One thing can be understood and done.</p>
          <h3>Reporter: In your opinion, is Microsoft a "leader" or a "challenger" in the field of artificial intelligence?</h3>
          <p>Hong Xiaowen: We have accumulated rich experience in the field of artificial intelligence. We have contributed and even led the development of AI in the past 25 years. As early as the early 1990s, we invested in the establishment of Microsoft Research Institute, the establishment of such a slogan, to allow computers to see, listen, speak, think and learn. In fact, when Microsoft Research was founded 25 years ago, artificial intelligence was already our strategic goal. Speech recognition, computer vision, Natural Language Processing and so on are the first few core teams. In the past 30 years, the error rate of our speech recognition and image recognition technology has dropped to 5.9% and 3.5%, which is basically the same as the human recognition rate, and even higher than the human level in the speech-to-text transcription accuracy.</p>
          <p>To be sure, we have made real progress in building systems with real artificial intelligence. But our vision is not only that, but that we also need to get AI out of the ivory tower, to become universal, and ultimately to improve the human condition.</p>
