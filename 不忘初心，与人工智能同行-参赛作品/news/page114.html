          <h2>ILIFE A4s sweeping robot brings you back to life</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>No matter who you ask, there is actually nothing more frustrating and time consuming than cleaning. Fortunately, the ILIFE A4s sweeper can do all the dirty work for you (very simple) and even know when to charge and when to run out of power. The ILIFE A4s sweeping robot with an automatic scheduling system is so convenient as a home assistant that it wants to write a "thank you card" for it after it has finished cleaning. ILIFE A4s also comes equipped with a Gen 3 Cyclone Power cleaning system for all types of floors - including carpets, and ILIFE A4s's super-intelligent sensing system allows it to never touch your furniture, get stuck in a corner, or fall down stairs. Yes, it is more coordinated than most people.</p>
          <p>To make life easier, the ILIFE A4s comes with two AAA batteries, a remote control, a charging base, an extra side brush and an AC power adapter. Most importantly, the battery lasts 140 minutes, which means you'll be able to watch at least three episodes of your favorite TV series, rather than sweating under the coffee table. Just set up a weekly cleaning schedule, click the CLEAN button, and then enjoy your leisure time and do what you want to do.</p>
          <h2>Add water to GROW</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>There is no doubt that you don't need to work hard for your indoor vegetables anymore. Why? Because GROW is changing the way we raise our little (but tasty) "Garden Friends". GROW uses an intelligent sensor irrigation system that automatically irrigates plants or vegetable seedlings according to the microclimate of your personal garden.</p>
          <p>Connect to APP - GROW with a smart planting machine. With GROW, you can become a gardener. GROW monitors soil conditions and notifies you every time a plant needs to be watered or trimmed (watering reminders act as lifeguards if you like). GROW Duo is equipped with intelligent planting machines, soil, seeds and nutrients, so you can grow the richest vegetable garden on all types of land. Most importantly, GROW will automatically water your vegetable garden when you can't provide the water you need. Whether you want to open up a vegetable garden or an indoor garden, you only need two AA batteries and the determination to buy GROWing.</p>
          <h2>Brava cooks food with light</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1133.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>A smart oven that connects Wi Fi and can quickly cook healthy food with light? Tell them they are dreaming! Well, in fact, this is a real thing happening. Brava, a desktop intelligent oven that cooks delicious and healthy food almost instantaneously, is an industry innovation. Why? This is related to Brava's infrared light system, which consists of six 10-inch (270mm) bulbs at the top and bottom of the oven arranged in three different areas to form the oven heating element. These lights can achieve full power in one second.</p>
          <p>There are three different areas in the oven that can be heated together or individually depending on the ingredients you want to cook. These areas can be moved up and down. Light will transmit energy to food. Brava also has a 5-megapixel fisheye camera that captures pictures of food to determine the cooking effect of your meal. Once Brava thinks your dinner is done, the super-intelligent oven will say "byeeee" and shut it down automatically, without your hands on it.</p>
          <h2>Nest Hello doorbell</h2>

        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1134.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Some of us may remember the days when the best doorbells played happy Tunes - but in 2018, if your doorbell didn't have a security camera, a built-in microphone, and a 160-degree wide-angle camera, you were clearly out of date. Nest Hello is a Wi-Fi-connected visual doorbell device that provides users with high-quality surveillance video material 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as well as facial recognition and two-way dialogue.</p>
          <p>Basically, if someone visits your home while you're working, you can still have a full conversation with the guest as if you were there. Facial recognition means that when someone you know comes to your home and leaves your home, you'll be notified that you don't need to view hours of surveillance videos manually to confirm. Luckily, Hello will recognize the faces of those who live in your home within a few days.</p>
