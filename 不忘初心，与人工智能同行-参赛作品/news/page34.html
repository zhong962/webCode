        <h1 class="title">China's AI development report 2018: China AI patents first in the world</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>In July 13th, the China Science and technology policy center of Tsinghua University released the report on China's artificial intelligence development 2018. The report finds that China ranks first in the world in the total number of papers, the number of highly cited papers and the number of artificial intelligence patents.</p>
          <p>Artificial intelligence is becoming a global topic, and the competition for AI talents in all countries is becoming more and more intense. So at present, what are the conditions for the development of artificial intelligence in China, and how far is it from China to become a real artificial intelligence power?</p>
          <p>Based on this, on July 13, the China Artificial Intelligence Development Report 2018 was released in the reception hall of the main building of Tsinghua University. The report describes the development of AI in China from four aspects: scientific and technological output and talent input, industrial development and market application, development strategy and policy environment, and social cognition and comprehensive impact.</p>
          <h3>Let's take a look at the conclusions in several reports.</h3>
          <p>China ranks first in the world in terms of the total number of papers and the number of highly cited papers. The output of AI papers in the CAS system ranks first in the world. However, China has the second largest number of talents in the world, and the proportion of outstanding talents is low.</p>
          <p>As for patents, China has become the country with the largest distribution of artificial intelligence patents in the world, slightly ahead of the United States and Japan in number.</p>
          <p>Industry, China's number of artificial intelligence enterprises ranked second in the world, Beijing is the world's most concentrated city of artificial intelligence enterprises;</p>
          <p>In terms of venture capital, 60% of the world's investment and financing in the field of artificial intelligence in China has become the world's most "money-absorbing" country.</p>

          <p>The report was co-authored by the China Science and Technology Policy Research Center of Tsinghua University, the Government Documentation Center of the School of Public Administration of Tsinghua University, the China Engineering Science and Technology Development Strategy Research Institute of Tsinghua University, Kerui Weian Co., Ltd., Scientist Online, the China Information and Communication Research Institute and Beijing Byte Beat Technology Co., Ltd.</p>
          <h2>China's total output of papers in AI is the world's first.</h2>

          <p>The top 20 countries and regions (1997-2017) are the world's largest Al papers.</p>
          <p>Over the past 20 years, many countries and regions around the world have participated in basic research in the field of artificial intelligence. Among them, China and the United States rank first and second in the world, and more than three times the output of Britain ranked third.</p>
          <p>Britain, Japan, Germany, India, France, Canada, Italy, Spain, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia constitute the second echelon of papers in this field. Iran, Brazil, Poland, the Netherlands, Turkey, Singapore, Switzerland and other countries formed the third echelon, but also produced a lot of papers in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
          <h2>The number of AI papers published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the largest in the world.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="one">

          <p>The above is the 20 largest organization of Al papers in the world (unit: article).</p>
          <p>Institutionally, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) of France and the University of California (UCLA) of the United States are among the leading institutions participating in AI-related research. The output of papers in the past 20 years has exceeded 24,000.</p>
          <p>Among the top 100 institutions in the field of global artificial intelligence, 87 are universities, 8 are research institutes, 3 are government agencies and only 2 enterprises. Among them, three government agencies are the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense (DOD) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); two enterprises are IBM and Microsoft.</p>
          <h2>The field of computer science and engineering is the most widely published subject.</h2>

          <p>The above is the distribution of major disciplines in 8 countries with the largest output of AI and global papers.</p>
          <p>From the perspective of subject distribution, computer science and engineering are the two disciplines with the largest number of papers published in the field of artificial intelligence in either the world or the eight countries with the largest output of papers. With the exception of India, Automation Systems is the third most produced discipline in the world and in seven other countries with the largest output of papers.</p>
          <p>In addition, robotics, mathematics and imaging science and photographic technology are also the focus of attention of the eight countries. Based on their own advantages and characteristics, countries have extended artificial intelligence to different disciplines. For example, India, as a country with energy shortages, applies artificial intelligence to energy and fuel disciplines; and China, taking advantage of its superiority in materials science, applies artificial intelligence to energy management (battery systems), robots, or other components manufacturing materials.</p>
