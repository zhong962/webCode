        <div class="two">
          <h3>Smart appliances transformation and upgrading, "hardware + content" two pronged approach</h3>
          <p>Under the background of the "Internet plus" strategy advocated by the state, the transformation and upgrading of the traditional household appliance industry has obviously increased. Frequent listing of various intelligent new products, such as intelligent robots, not only injects new vitality into the market, but also accelerates the fierce competition among household appliances enterprises.</p>
          <p>However, blindly following the trend of the industry has led to the development of misunderstanding. Many gimmicks of smart appliances are too formalistic, purely for intelligence and intelligence. As long as the remote control, Wi-Fi connection and other functions are labeled as "smart" label, with an APP, shake itself into a "smart appliances. For users, this practice actually increases the difficulty of user operation, and appears to be flashy.</p>
          <p>However, this problem will improve in 2016. With the upcoming opening of AWE 2016, we find that many manufacturers have begun to introduce integrated intelligent solutions to solve the problem of interconnection between different household appliances products. At the same time, mobile phones are no longer the only entrance to smart homes, allowing users to control their TV and other smart home appliances in a variety of ways, including the recent boom in service-oriented smart robots.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1531.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>At the same time, the construction of content ecology is also an important symbol of the transformation of traditional household appliance manufacturers to the Internet. Insiders said: Internet + not only brings intelligent products, the emergence of large-scale personalized production mode, the integration of virtual and real channels, but also brings about changes in business mode. In the future, household appliances will become a carrier, and services and content will become a new source of income.</p>
          <p>At present, Haier, TCL, Skyworth and other traditional power plants have launched a series of cooperation with Tencent, Ali, LTV and other Internet companies, hoping to create a "hardware + software + service" television ecosphere. With the increasing number of active subscribers per day, smart TV in China is expected to start making money from content this year.</p>
          <h3>Platform trend continues to be the main theme of smart home development.</h3>
          <p>With the deepening of the concept of interconnection of all things, the popularity of smart home in the industry is not two. The market for smart home appliances and services will grow at an annual rate of 8% to 10% over the next five years, according to research and markets.</p>
          <p>However, in this unprecedented huge market prospects, the chaotic terminal market, incompatible with each other's products, has become the biggest shackles restricting the development of smart home. As mentioned above, smart products can no longer meet the needs of people's lives, consumers really need a more intelligent, personalized, interactive overall solution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1532.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>In the past 2015, "platform" has been the main theme of the development of the smart home industry, whether it is Apple, Google, such as technology giants or Samsung, Haier, Panasonic and other power plants, are pushing the concept of platform. Apple launched HomeKit, Google launched Brillo's Internet of Things operating system, Samsung's Smart Things smart home platform, and Haier's U + platform and Smart Living Circle for smart living... It is expected that this trend will remain in 2016.</p>
          <p>If the reason for the growing trend of platform is the standard debate of smart home, then the future smart home market, the integrity of platform construction and value-added services will be the key to success.</p>
          <p>According to the understanding of thousands of intelligent customers, the unification of communication standards is an important measure to solve the "fragmentation" of smart home, and plays an important role in the series connection of multiple types of equipment. But as technology continues to mature, competition among all kinds of communication standards will gradually ease. Family security, intelligent health, intelligent community and other new areas will become the future competition of smart home.</p>
          <p>With the continuous progress of sensors and the evolution of the new generation of information technology, such as big data, cloud computing, mobile Internet, the intellectual boundaries between machines and people continue to be shortened, more service-oriented robots are expected to enter work and life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1533.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>According to Robot Zero CEO to Mr. Zhonghong, it is expected that in the future the application of service robots will witness tremendous growth in the fields of personal companionship, home service and smart home. By 2017, the service robot market will reach 50 billion US dollars, becoming the most potential growth market today.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we will see not only sweeping robots, companion robots, but also more intelligent robots will become the center of smart home, human-computer dialogue, security and other advanced operations into human life.</p>
          <h3>VR and UAV become new turning points of intelligent hardware.</h3>
          <p>Influenced by the upsurge of innovators and intelligences, one after another new intelligent hardware products have been launched on the platform of Jingdong Zhongchi and Taobao Zhongchi. However, after the boom and chaos, smart hardware-based start-ups went bankrupt and disappeared in late 2015, making it the best explanation.</p>
          <p>Such as intelligent sphygmomanometer, weight meter and other related to health concepts of intelligent hardware, as well as the main safety concept of intelligent door lock, intelligent driving recorder and so on why not achieve the desired state? Thousands of Intelligent Customers believe that most of the current intelligent hardware devices, still belong to the technology precipitation period, in the absence of a solution to the actual problem is premature to market. Single function or users can not achieve the desired state in the actual application process, resulting in some people who use intelligent wearable equipment choose to give up after a short period of use.</p>
          <p>However, in 2016, smart hardware may usher in a new turning point, that is, the direction of product innovation from the original intelligent transformation of existing electronic products to the creation of new smart products.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p1534.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>In the case of VR (virtual reality) and UAV, these new technologies are likely to be the beginning of bringing smart hardware products to the masses faster. For example, the application of VR technology in game entertainment may become a major direction of smart hardware entrepreneurship, rather than focusing all innovation on sports, health and other non-rigid needs. However, entrepreneurs need to be vigilant that, in addition to functional hardware, content construction is likely to become a major shackle of the outbreak of VR equipment.</p>
          <p>In addition, as the next generation of cutting-edge technology consumption, wearable equipment and fashion, social integration, is also a major trend worthy of attention. At present, wearable equipment is still in its infancy, mainly to solve the sensor and power consumption problems, and mainly wear on the wrist, limiting its further play. However, with the continuous improvement of new sensors and the use of large data, diversified forms of wearable equipment is a major trend.</p>
