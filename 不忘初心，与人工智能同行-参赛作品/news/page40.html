        <div class="two">
          <p>In recent years, artificial intelligence, like a wave, has swept across various fields, the most interesting of which is the entry of artificial intelligence into education.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p391.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>The impact of artificial intelligence on education is undoubtedly enormous, compared with efficient computers, teachers do not seem to have much advantage, but in fact, the presence of artificial intelligence will better help teachers teach.</p>
          <p>For example, in China, English teaching has been faced with varying degrees of difficulty. For language learning, pronunciation accuracy is often one of the important criteria for measuring learning outcomes. However, due to the uneven distribution of educational resources in China, many English teachers in second-and third-tier cities are faced with difficulties in the examination because their spoken English is not standard.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p392.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>The emergence of speech recognition technology will make oral English teaching more perfect. Through AI oral teaching, all students can enjoy the same level of teaching, thus avoiding the impact of objective factors on performance, to a certain extent, to ensure the fairness of education.</p>
          <p>Similar to the above, the paperless examination has become an important new form of examination. In a broad sense, paperless examination includes the use of computers to establish and manage the question bank, test paper selection, examination and marking and other links. It not only innovates the traditional paper examination form, but also greatly improves the design and evaluation of the examination. Intelligent network test paper generation system has the advantages of low cost, low efficiency, good confidentiality and high consistency. Even under more restrictions, it can generate test papers according to the given test paper formation strategy to meet the requirements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p393.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>At the same time, the network-based test database can collect the classical exercises written by teachers, centralize and share the success of teachers'labor, and ensure the high quality of test papers. Artificial intelligence marking system can effectively identify test papers, reduce the possibility of error, greatly improve the efficiency of marking process.</p>
          <p>The future intelligent robot should be a kind of robot with human perception and behavior ability, super memory, learning, reasoning, planning ability, emotional, humanized, can replace human in the real environment to work independently. It will have an immeasurable impact on the development of social productive forces and the progress of human society, as well as on the improvement of people's life, work and way of thinking.</p>
