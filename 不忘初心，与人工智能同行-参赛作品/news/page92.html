          <p>The theme of this conference is Intelligent Experience, Intelligent Life, focusing on the application of products, focusing on the display of terminal products based on artificial intelligence technology and algorithms. 150 enterprises and artificial intelligence institutions from 10 countries participated in the exhibition. The exhibition area is about 18,000 square meters, showing more than 1,000 kinds of artificial intelligence products.</p>
          <p>Pan Yunhe, academician and former executive vice president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering; Wang Yongdong, senior vice president of Microsoft; Zheng Yelai, vice president of Huawei; He Guowei, CEO of Philips Greater China; and Hu Guoping, senior vice president of HUST and President of Academy of Sciences, gave keynote performances on artificial intelligence technology. Say.</p>
          <p>As the main event of the Expo, the results of the Gold and Silver Awards of the 2018 Global Expo on the Application of Artificial Intelligence Products were officially announced at the opening ceremony and a grand award ceremony was held. HKUST News Ferry, Philips and Spitz won the Gold Award of the 2018 Global Artificial Intelligence Products Application Exposition. Broadview Technology, Konley Blue, Haikang Video, Youcai, Tianju-di-he-yun won the Silver Award from Technology.</p>
          <p>At the same time, in order to promote the development of artificial intelligence industry, strengthen academic and technological exchanges, promote the innovation and application of artificial intelligence, observe the trend of the industry, and help the development of innovative enterprises, the Center for Entrepreneurial States has conducted a systematic survey of more than 200 AI start-ups in China, from the development capacity, innovation capacity, financing capacity and other dimensions. Index, select "2018 China's artificial intelligence innovation and growth enterprise top 50". Cool home music has been successfully launched on its technology innovation and scene application in the field of AI.</p>

          <p>Cool Care has been committed to cloud rendering, cloud design, BIM, VR, AR, AI technology research and development, from the technical solution to the efficiency of the interior design industry. Home decoration industry is a sector with many links and pain points, which provides a good landing scene for AI technology. In the attempt to introduce AI technology into the home design industry, cool home music has made some achievements.</p>
          <p>In 2017, Cool Care employee Huang Zeyi Artificial Intelligence Research Paper was selected in the top international academic conference CVPR, after which Cool Care to further determine the AI + home design strategy, will explore the application of AI technology in the field of home design scene, from the design entrance to improve industry efficiency and experience.</p>
          <p>After nearly half a year of research, on March 28, 2018, Cool Care announced the ABC artificial intelligence program, in the application of artificial intelligence launched a heavy map search model function, which is Cool Care for the home business process visible and unavailable pain points, the introduction of a key to match between the template, cabinet intelligent layout and other functions, with the aid of AI Another functional innovation and practice of technology.</p>
          <p>After the search model is launched, cool Jiale will further promote AI+ automatic design. On the basis of large databases such as decoration design database, home effect database, commodity model material database, style database, and user preferences, we can learn design knowledge through scene recognition and machine, such as the characteristics and rules of each style, and carry out precise data analysis. At the same time, Cool Care will explore the simultaneous opening of the virtual commodity library, to provide users with real purchasable commodity information or links to achieve while watching while buying while searching, to create a complete landing path for users from what they see.</p>
          <p>With the rapid explosion of big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence technology, the curtain of intelligent transformation of the home industry has slowly opened. Driven by AI + Big Data Dual Engine, Cool Care will initiate a smart revolution in the home industry and help the home industry achieve WYSIWYG in an all-round way.</p>
