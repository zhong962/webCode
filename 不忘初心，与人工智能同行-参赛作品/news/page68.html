        <h1 class="title">China's artificial intelligence industry policy system has basically taken shape.</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>AI is becoming a new industry of policy focus. Reporters through a detailed comb found that up to now, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jilin, Guizhou and other 20 provinces and cities, according to the actual development of the local situation, the introduction of artificial intelligence industry policies and measures. The industry believes that the central level attaches great importance to the development of artificial intelligence, and has issued a series of artificial intelligence industry development policies. With the emergence of more specific measures around the country, China's artificial intelligence industry policy system has basically taken shape, and is forming a good central-local linkage effect. This will not only help the AI industry policy fall to the ground quickly at the central level, but also accelerate the application of the industry, and faster integration with key industries such as automobile, medical, logistics, manufacturing.</p>
          <p>Due to the high importance of the industry, the layout of China's AI industry is earlier. In July 2015, the State Council issued the Guiding Opinions on Actively Promoting the "Internet +" Action, which first proposed the cultivation and development of artificial intelligence industry, and listed artificial intelligence as one of the 11 key actions. In March 2016, the development of artificial intelligence industry was written into the "13th Five-Year Plan". Several industrial guidance documents, such as the "Internet + Three-year Action Plan for Artificial Intelligence", "National Science and Technology Innovation Plan for the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan", "Innovation and Development Action for Intelligent Hardware Industry (2015-2018)" and "National Strategic Emerging Industry Development Plan for the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan", were published that year. All of these industrial guidance documents have contributed to the development of Artificial Intelligence In March 2017, artificial intelligence was first written in the government work report; in October 2017, artificial intelligence was written in the nineteenth National Congress report, artificial intelligence and real economy integration became an important goal of industrial development; in July and November of that year, the State Council published the "New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" and "New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan". The three-year plan of action to promote the development of the new generation of artificial intelligence industry, while making further plans for the development of artificial intelligence industry, proposes to accelerate the integration of artificial intelligence industry and various industries.</p>
          <p>With the continuous development of the industrial policy at the central level, the development of the AI industry is becoming more and more important. Since 2016, Shanghai, Beijing, Zhejiang, Guangdong and other places have issued local industrial policies and measures in accordance with their actual conditions. Up to now, 20 provinces in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jilin and Guizhou, have issued policies on AI industry. For example, Shanghai promulgated the "Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Innovation Special Support Implementation Rules", Tianjin promulgated the "Tianjin Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology Innovation Special Action Plan", Jiangxi Province promulgated the "on accelerating the development of artificial intelligence and intelligent manufacturing measures". In addition, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guizhou and other places also proposed to increase financial support and preferential tax incentives for the AI industry, such as the "Internet +" special action plan for artificial intelligence in Guizhou Province, which clearly stated that more than 500 million yuan of investment had been completed before 2018, and Jiangxi's efforts to speed up the development of artificial intelligence and intelligent manufacturing. A number of measures said that preferential tax policies will be introduced to support industrial development.</p>
          <p>The industry believes that China's artificial intelligence industry policy system has basically formed, and is forming a good central-local linkage effect. Wu He Quan, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told reporters that formulating and promulgating specific industrial policies is one of the powerful means to promote industrial development in China. Through the introduction of specific policies targeted, on the one hand, can promote the rapid application of artificial intelligence technology, accelerate the formation of artificial intelligence application market; on the other hand, it is conducive to the rapid integration of industry, University and research, the formation of a complete artificial intelligence industry ecology, is conducive to the expansion and strengthening of the artificial intelligence industry.</p>
          <p>Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and other enterprises in an interview with reporters said that the central and local industrial policies take into account the development direction of the industry in the process of development, support measures, industrial applications, industrial risks and other aspects of the problem, to the future healthy and orderly development of AI industry. At present, China's artificial intelligence industry policy is still in constant improvement, which will further enhance the vitality of the development of artificial intelligence industry, help the rapid application of artificial intelligence industry in China, and be accepted by the community, for the future development of artificial intelligence industry, mature and strong foundation.</p>
          <p>Reporters previously learned from a number of authoritative channels, China will also introduce a number of detailed measures to encourage the development of the artificial intelligence industry.</p>
          <p>It is reported that China's artificial intelligence measures will be divided into three categories in the future. The first is the specific industrial landing policies, including the introduction of fiscal and tax preferential policies for small and medium-sized AI enterprises and start-ups, supporting the development of AI enterprises through tax preferences for high-tech enterprises and the addition and deduction of R&amp;D costs, guiding market forces, and establishing and improving AI industry development funds. The first is to promote the innovation and development of various kinds of artificial intelligence, including promoting artificial intelligence innovation bases according to the layout and framework of national scientific and technological innovation bases, guiding existing national key laboratories, enterprise national key laboratories, national engineering laboratories and other bases related to artificial intelligence, and focusing on the forefront of the new generation of artificial intelligence. The third category is to formulate laws, regulations and ethical norms to promote the development of artificial intelligence, and to carry out legal issues related to the application of artificial intelligence, such as recognition of civil and criminal liability, protection of privacy and property rights, and utilization of information security, focusing on automatic driving. In order to lay a legal foundation for the rapid application of new technology, it is necessary to speed up the research and formulation of relevant safety management laws and regulations.</p>
