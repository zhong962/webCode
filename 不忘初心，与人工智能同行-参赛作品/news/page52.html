        <div class="two">
          <p>"Foxconn is committed to promoting the deep integration of the Internet, big data, artificial intelligence and the real economy, and implementing in-depth innovation and development strategy of the industrial Internet under the background of accelerating the development of the digital economy and promoting the integration of the real economy and the digital economy with the supply-side structural reform as the main line." Gou Taiming, chairman of Foxconn Technology Group, said on June 6 at the Forum on Integration of Real Economy and Digital Economy.</p>

          <p>The deep integration of industrial AI and advanced manufacturing has become the core driving force of the new round of industrial revolution. The innovation of intelligent manufacturing technology drives the multi-industry of economy and society into the fast lane of development, and the industrial Internet emerges as the times require. On June 6, representatives of international participants and industry experts held in-depth exchanges and discussions at Foxconn Sub-Forum on Industrial Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Manufacturing Dialogue. The Honorary Professor Fine Tech Corp. of Tokyo University, Victor Nakagawa, academician of the Russian National Academy of Sciences, Kondratenko Vladimir, Director Nagesh Velaga of the Indian COSMOS Group, Chief Adviser to Foxconn's Industrial Artificial Intelligence, Li Jie, CEO of Tree Root Interconnection Technology Co., Ltd. and other guests were invited to attend.</p>
          <h3>30 years of intensive development, leading to advanced manufacturing technology</h3>
          <p>"Now Hon Hai's production and manufacturing technology is no less than any other enterprise in the world, with the world's first-class production and manufacturing technology." "Foxconn Technology Group was invested and founded by Taiwan Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd," said Professor Nakagawa Weixiong, an honorary professor at Tokyo University. Foxconn has been growing rapidly in the past 30 years. The lamp-extinguishing factory, the production line of unmanned automated smart phones and the precision cutting tools are all the fruits of the development and application of Foxconn's advanced science and technology. Behind the advanced technology is the massive input of Foxconn talent incubation. At the meeting, Nakagawa Xiong introduced that every year Foxconn transported a large number of technicians to Japan for training. Reserving the backbone of technology and introducing advanced manufacturing technology have become an important measure for Foxconn to move towards intelligent manufacturing of industrial Internet.</p>
          <p>At present, Foxconn is actively promoting the construction of industrial Internet. According to Nakagawa Weixiong, Foxconn, relying on its 30 years of manufacturing experience and a large number of outstanding engineers, and using IoT, AI and other emerging technologies, will certainly be able to create a world-leading manufacturing system.</p>
          <p>He Dongdong, CEO of Tree Root Interconnection Technology Co., Ltd., believes that China needs an industrial Internet platform with three characteristics. First is the deep integration of industry and numbers. Foxconn's decades of industrial experience, industrial background, for the realization of industrial + Internet is undoubtedly more advantageous. The second is to adapt to local needs. The solution provided by the industrial Internet needs to adapt to the local conditions of China. Third, there are good opportunities for development. In the industrial Internet and industrial big data scenarios, equipment objects, industrial big data, application scenarios and other reserves, creating a good opportunity for the development of industrial Internet. "Global giants like Foxconn, with their own data, equipment and scenes, must have a chance to change lanes and overtake in the industrial Internet competition." He Dongdong said.</p>
          <h3>Flowering, industrial AI and advanced manufacturing</h3>
          <p>"Industrial AI is more focused on industrial systems." Foxconn Industrial Artificial Intelligence General Advisor Li Jie mentioned in the sub-forum round table, which also shows the infinite vitality of industrial artificial intelligence in the industrial field. During the round table, Professor Zhu Jun of Tsinghua University, Director of Industrial Internet Research Office of Saidi Think Tank, Yuan Xiaoqing, Vice President of Hexconn Manufacturing Intelligence Global Program, Zhou Liang, CEO of Tree Root Interconnection Technologies Co., Ltd. and Mr. He Dongdong held in-depth discussions on the integration of industrial artificial intelligence with advanced manufacturing.</p>
          <p>According to Professor Zhu Jun of Tsinghua University, artificial intelligence in industrial scenes is a challenge and opportunity. First of all, to achieve scene empowerment requires deep accumulation in the industry. Artificial intelligence technology itself, but also needs to be deeply integrated with the industry and collision, artificial intelligence and industrial data integration should be a long-term process. "I'm glad to see Foxconn at the forefront of its strategic layout, with real scenes and data. It's Foxconn's opportunity and great news for AI." At the meeting, Zhu Jun agreed with Foxconn's forward-looking strategic layout.</p>
          <p>Zhou Liang, on the spot, takes the field of measurement as an example, and lists the breakthrough applications brought by AI. Industrial AI and industrial big data play a key role in it. Yuan Xiaoqing also emphasized that the manufacturing enterprises in the future will be the main force of industrial AI.</p>

        <div class="two">
          <p>And industrial artificial intelligence dialogue advanced manufacturing, its core goal is to create customer value, then what does customer value mean? CEO He Dongdong, the root Interconnect Technology Co., has given its own answer. First, artificial intelligence achievements in consumer areas, such as image recognition, visual recognition and human-computer interaction, have been applied in the field of industrial Internet. For example, Foxconn uses image recognition to detect electronic products. The second point is also the focus at present. One is fault prediction and health model, the other two is auxiliary driving. Taking auxiliary driving as an example, it will be more difficult in industrial processing places. Because the amount of control is variable, there are more variables, but this is a challenge and an opportunity. "Artificial intelligence assists operation, assists driving, assists decision-making this is very important point," He Dongdong stressed.</p>
          <p>At the meeting, several big cafes all affirmed the integration of industrial artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing, and looked forward to the future development of Foxconn Industrial Internet. In the era of interconnection with opportunities and challenges, success is undoubtedly reserved for those who are prepared.</p>
          <h3>Artificial intelligence for energy and multi domain applications</h3>
          <p>In the sub-forum, several important aspects of the integration of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies into human production activities were also interpreted. Kondratenko Vladimir, academician of the Russian National Academy of Sciences, and Director Nagesh Velaga, director of the Indian COSMOS Group, shared about environmental protection and digital factories respectively.</p>
          <p>Kondratenko Vladimir, an academician of the Russian National Academy of Sciences, believes that environmental problems affect the environment on which humans live. The application of AI technology is particularly important. Kondratenko Vladimir also shared several new environmental technologies at the conference. Such as high-purity nano-ion water treatment waste gas, sewage treatment high-efficiency coagulant, low-temperature separation of various substances in the water pulse vacuum equipment.</p>
          <p>Nagesh Velaga shared the content of intelligent digital factory from a practical point of view. Intelligent digital factories based on data storage, analysis, and cloud computing are excellent at improving overall efficiency and capacity.</p>
          <p>At present, a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is booming in the world. The fusion of industrial artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing will undoubtedly become an important engine to promote the new industrial revolution. It is believed that under the leadership of Foxconn and other outstanding enterprises, the future industry will also present an omni-directional, deep-seated and revolutionary impact.</p>
