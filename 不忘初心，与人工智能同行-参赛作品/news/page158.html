          <p>Artificial intelligence is mainly divided into six forms: human-like intelligence, brain-like intelligence, autonomous intelligence, hybrid intelligence, cross-media intelligence and swarm intelligence. What happens to the UAV with artificial intelligence? Imagine that perhaps the future world of Hollywood science fiction is slowly becoming a reality.</p>
          <p>Academician Wu Cheng of the Chinese Academy of Engineering said at the forum, "China's autonomous unmanned systems will develop in the direction of artificial intelligence in the future, and autonomous unmanned systems are the products of the new upsurge of artificial intelligence. According to the "2005-2030 UAV system roadmap" drawn up by the U.S. Department of Defense, China's UAV autonomous capability is expected to reach 7-8 levels, that is, the ability to cluster, intelligent multi-task decomposition and co-operation; by 2030, UAV will achieve a 50% coverage of the whole airspace, industry-wide applications, autonomous capability to reach 9-10 levels. The goal. "</p>

        <div class="two">
          <p>At this year's Zhuhai Air Show, CETC of China Electrical Engineering Department demonstrated the first prototype system of fixed-wing UAV cluster test in China, which realized the verification of 67-scale cluster principle and broke the previous world record of 50 fixed-wing UAV clusters held by the U.S. Navy.</p>
          <p>Last year, the "Internet +" three year action plan for artificial intelligence was formulated by the national development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of science and technology, the Ministry of industry and information technology and the central network office. It clearly proposed the integration of artificial intelligence technology in the field of unmanned systems, and the development of various forms of unmanned devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ships. We will accelerate the commercialization of consumer and industry-class unmanned aerial vehicles and improve the airworthiness management, safety management and operation mechanism of unmanned aerial vehicles and other unmanned aerial vehicles. To promote the intelligent level of unmanned systems and promote innovative applications in logistics, agriculture, surveying and mapping, power patrol, security patrol, emergency rescue and other important industries.</p>
          <p>For the current hot consumer UAV market, although according to the UAV system roadmap standard, the domestic consumer UAV technology level in Xinjiang and other countries is still in the primary stage, but at present some consumer UAVs have been able to automatically avoid obstacles through sensors, cameras and other, but also rely on machine vision to fly. Environment detection, analysis of environmental characteristics to achieve self-planning path, as people see obstacles know bypass, in addition to Intel this year through intelligent algorithms, 500 multi-rotor UAVs successfully staged in the air formation lighting show, can see that consumer UAVs are also beginning to move towards higher-level UAV intelligence Move forward.</p>
