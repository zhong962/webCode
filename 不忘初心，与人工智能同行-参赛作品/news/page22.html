        <h1 class="title">In the field of AI, the top 50 of universities ranked no mainland Chinese universities.</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>In mid-October, Wuzhen Think Tank, in conjunction with Netease Technology and Netease Intelligence, released a series of reports on the Wuzhen Index: Global Artificial Intelligence Development Report (2016). The report gives a detailed analysis of a series of hot issues in AI, including the size of the enterprise distribution, investment and financing, research results, segmentation areas and so on.</p>
          <p>Especially in the research results, we have noticed in the report: in the direction of artificial intelligence, the global TOP50 ranking of the university does not have a Chinese mainland university.</p>
          <p>Why is that?</p>
          <p>The report points out that the ranking of AI universities is based on academic and influential factors, including the number of papers published in the field of AI, the quality of individual papers, and the number of citations. Influences include the number of outstanding alumni in the field of artificial intelligence and the number of references to the direction of artificial intelligence in Wikipedia.</p>
          <p>After reviewing the report, we found that almost all the top 50 universities in the world were from North America, Britain and other European universities. The only Asian universities on the list were Taiwan University at 37, Tokyo University at 47, and Singapore National University at 50. Why did universities in mainland China and Hongkong fail to list? We asked many parties about this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p211.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p212.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>We first consulted Qu Xiaofeng from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He said: the list needs to be looked at in a complete way, and all the indicators set to the design indicators should be taken into account.</p>
          <p>First of all, this list is for artificial intelligence, the definition of artificial intelligence is still very vague, which areas, which indicators need to be included in the consideration is relatively vague. In particular, outstanding alumni and successful people are mostly experienced and unable to belong to a certain school.</p>
          <p>In addition, the number of papers and quotes are very easy to be counted, but they are not powerful enough. It is very easy for American universities to publish English papers. This is easy to do. Taiwan University, Tokyo University and Singapore National University are all Asian universities, but the internationalization is better, so the ranking is better.</p>
          <p>Another is the issue of national defense. All the top universities in China have the problem of confidentiality. Our aerospace research is totally confidential to the outside world. Most of the listed areas are transparent to the United States, so those academic achievements are completely open to the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
          <p>Another possible factor is that the increase in citation numbers takes time.</p>
          <p>We also consulted Xu Kui from Tsinghua University：</p>
          <p>I think this evaluation method is inaccurate. This evaluation method has a high tendency to give weight to previous research results, that is to say, this index only represents the past achievements of the mainland in artificial intelligence. In recent years, China has made remarkable achievements in intensive learning, computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing, and this influence is now not reflected in the entire field of artificial intelligence.</p>
          <p>Li Changsheng, from National University of Singapore,said: </p>
          <p>I think there is still a gap between our country and foreign countries in the innovative theory of artificial intelligence, especially the United States. Although we are not inferior to others in terms of application, our R&amp;D capability is relatively weak and there are few truly influential academic achievements. In addition, I think foreign support in the field of basic research is better, so that many researchers can adhere to do in a certain direction, there will be more innovative results.</p>
          <p>Comments from all sides show that there are different views on how to rank AI universities by the number of papers, the quality of individual papers, the number of citations, the number of outstanding alumni in the field of artificial intelligence, and the number of citations in the direction of Wikipedia's artificial intelligence.</p>
          <p>On the basis of the views of all parties, we summarize the following: </p>
          <p>The evaluation method used in the list gives higher weight to previous research results. Many classical papers (such as Hinton, Lecun, Bengio, etc.) may be cited many times to increase their weight proportion, thus affecting the ranking.</p>
          <p>The index set in the list is easy to statistical indicators, which makes the relevant data easy to obtain but its evaluation is not strong enough.</p>
          <p>There is still a gap between our country and foreign countries in the innovative theory of artificial intelligence, especially the United States. But China has made remarkable achievements in the areas of in-depth learning, computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing in recent years, and this influence is not yet manifested throughout the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
