        <h1 class="title">China's artificial intelligence market will grow by 75% in 2018</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>A research group jointly organized by the China Science and Technology Policy Research Center of Tsinghua University and the Government Documentation Center of the School of Public Administration of Tsinghua University recently released the China Artificial Intelligence Development Report 2018 in Beijing. According to the report, the size of the AI market in China will reach 23.7 billion yuan in 2017, an increase of 67% over the same period of last year. The AI market is expected to grow by 75% in 2018.</p>
          <p>The report points out that the number of AI enterprises in China ranks second in the world, while Beijing is the city with the largest concentration of AI enterprises in the world. The number of AI enterprises in China has increased rapidly since 2012. As of June 2018, the number of AI enterprises in China has reached 1011, ranking second in the world, but the gap with the United States is still very obvious (2028). China's AI enterprises are highly concentrated in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong. Among the 20 cities with the largest number of AI enterprises in the world, Beijing ranks first with 395 enterprises, including Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hangzhou. The application technology of AI enterprises in China mainly concentrates on voice, vision and natural language processing, but the proportion of basic hardware is very small.</p>
          <p>China has become the largest country in the world with the largest scale of investment and financing in artificial intelligence. From 2013 to the first quarter of 2018, China's investment and financing in the field of artificial intelligence accounted for 60% of the world, becoming the world's most "money-absorbing" country. However, judging from the number of investment and financing, the US is still the most active country in the field of artificial intelligence. At home, Beijing is far ahead of other regions in terms of financing amount and amount, and the investment in artificial intelligence in Shanghai and Guangdong is also very active. Since 2014, the proportion of early investment in AI investment and financing activities in China has declined gradually, and investment activities have become more rational. However, A round of financing is still dominant.</p>
          <p>Artificial intelligence has been applied in many vertical fields such as health care, finance, education and security. In 2017, the global robot market reached US $23 billion 200 million and China accounted for 27%. Others such as UAVs, smart homes, smart grids, smart security, smart medicine and smart finance are also developing rapidly.</p>
