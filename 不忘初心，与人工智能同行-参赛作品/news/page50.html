        <h1 class="title">Artificial intelligence has given us the opportunity to rethink and choose jobs</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is known as the last invention created by human beings. The general basic income, once referred to as the topic of privacy, is now being discussed openly. Design thinking has become the mainstream business vocabulary and has become a more people-centered world road.</p>
          <p>These three unique concepts will have a strong impact on the work of the next few decades.</p>
          <h3>Catalyzer</h3>
          <p>Artificial intelligence is fantastic, it can diagnose cancer, create art, and in just three days learn from the most complex games that humans have inherited over 3,000 years of strategy. No technology has ever had such a positive impact in our lives. But AI is not without flaws. The danger of data bias and lack of moral foundation is imminent. Moreover, artificial intelligence may take away the worries of our work and has aroused great public concern.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p491.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Media coverage of the threat to AI focuses on low-skilled, monotonous jobs, whether in driving or manufacturing. In fact, this will be the first major industry that has been most affected. There are millions of truck drivers in the United States alone, not to mention thousands of shared car companies. But these companies will not voice. They are trying to replace drivers, which is the way for these companies to develop. However, unemployment caused by AI will not be confined to the working class.</p>
          <p>Journalism is being automated, medicine is being automated, and even the law is being automated. Of course, the development of automation is at an early stage, but eventually people will lose their jobs. It is not yet clear where the displaced workers will find their future jobs. No matter how severe the long-term unemployment rate will be, at least in the short term. The upcoming job transfer has led some to wonder what role the government should play if new jobs are delayed or, worse, never found.</p>
          <p>In the next decade or two, artificial intelligence will replace millions of workers, which could have a serious impact on the poor and working class. In optimistic circumstances, these people will be retrained quickly and employed elsewhere to avoid financial distress. In pessimism, AI will take the place of more work. Machines can better accomplish every task and cost less than employing labor. Both sides of the debate have reliable arguments: </p>
          <h3>Government participation and universal basic income (UBI)</h3>
          <p>Different political positions may solve the problem, and governments can encourage retraining programs or reform the education system. But perhaps the most attractive (and radical) policy is the universal basic income system, or UBI, which has gained increasing attention in recent years. From accidental experimentation to Nordic politics to the support of Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg, UBI has now formally entered the public and political arena. So, what is it exactly?</p>
          <p>In short, UBI (general basic income) is a fixed amount of money paid to each member of a particular group. The only requirement is that the recipient is a member of the required problem group (usually a state or country), so the term is generic, and UBI is actually very simple.</p>
          <p>Once artificial intelligence replaces workers, governments can distribute artificially created wealth to help offset the loss of income that many people may face. In addition, UBI can also be used to ensure that each child receives a gift every year at the age of 18. The money can be used to pay for college tuition, to start a business, or to pay debts. Whether the recipient is a child or an adult, the UBI will provide a safety net for them when they receive retraining or stop working altogether. But this policy still leaves many people hesitant.</p>
          <h3>Play the devil's advocate</h3>
          <p>If some people don't have to work to survive, how many of them will stop doing anything? Imagine that providing advanced virtual reality to these aimless people will not require work. Decades later, people spent more time in VR, and this result seems to be even more infeasible. If most people do become lazy, is UBI worth it? But Y Combinator founder Sam Altman thinks so: </p>
          <p>"Maybe 90 percent of people smoke marijuana and indulge in video games, but if the remaining 10 percent create exciting new products, new services and new wealth, that's still a huge victory."</p>
          <p>Although this logic is meaningful at the economic level, it is defective at the human level. The problem is that for those 90%, life will be less meaningful. Now, many of us have gained a great sense of achievement from what we have done. The younger generation will increasingly be attracted to companies that have clear goals other than making money. So, although it is a lofty ideal to save people from poverty, we have lost a valuable goal in life. If UBI is adopted, we need to use it to redefine the meaning of work and life.</p>
          <p>"Only a meaningful life is a great life. Without meaningful work, it is difficult to have meaningful life. -- Jim Collins</p>
          <h3>Our opportunity: design the world we want.</h3>
          <p>Massive political and technological turbulence has created fertile soil for building new social structures. Artificial intelligence frees us from repetitive tasks and automates much of today's physical and mental work. This will be the biggest change in human history. In the coming decades, we will have the opportunity to change the concept of our work, rest and goals. But we humans do not like turbulence, and as long as we can redefine it, we will again seek stability and convention. So we have only a brief transition period.</p>

        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p492.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Once our first habits are consolidated in the AI / UBI world, we will gradually become content with our new jobs as usual, and people will only need to read Animal Farm to see the truth. We're going back to maintenance mode, and we're going to stop pushing for better results.</p>
          <p>"Like individuals, first impressions and early habits produce lasting prejudices against character and temper." - Alexander Hamilton.</p>
          <p>Our greatest hope of redefining goals in this short transition period is design thinking, a process of understanding humans, asking the right questions, encouraging external thinking, and quickly iterating solutions. Crucially, this process does not start with finding solutions to problems, but by creating different perspectives to identify potential problems. The end result is the creation of people centered products, services and ideas.</p>
          <p>In an artificial intelligence or UBI driven world, finding the target needs human centered. Design thinking does not guarantee a perfect future, but it does guarantee a more compassionate future.</p>
          <p>This is a gift from AI. This is the best chance for us to redefine our goals.</p>
