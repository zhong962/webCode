        <h1 class="title">How can make us 'indispensable'  when the rise of robots and artificial intelligence</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Tencent Financial News CNBC reported that Malcolm Gladwell, a well-known American bestseller, pointed out that with the gradual penetration of artificial intelligence into the labor market and the increasing number of robots starting to work, one way to ensure that they are "indispensable" employees in the company is to be good at doing that. Some robots are not good at doing things.</p>
          <p>In general, he said, "I am not a fussy person about AI. I happen to think that there are a lot of things that we need humans to do but haven't done yet, and that involve communicating with them, empathizing with them, and helping them out. The fact that jobs in some fields have been replaced by robots or artificial intelligence does not mean the end of the world is coming.</p>
          <p>Most Americans seem to agree with Mr view. According to a Gallup poll published in 2017, about 50 percent of U.S. employees are not worried about their jobs being replaced by robots in the next five or twenty years.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p531.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is expected to put up to 10 million U.S. service and warehouse jobs at high risk of being replaced in the next five to 10 years, according to data released by CB Insights, a research firm. But Americans aren't so worried about setbacks in their careers, such as outsourcing or layoffs.</p>
          <p>In 2016, a Pew Research Center survey showed that 65 percent of Americans expect robots and artificial intelligence to replace humans in the next 50 years to do most of the work now done by humans. However, when asked about their impact on their own work, they said they were not so worried. 80% of the respondents felt that their posts would not be replaced in the next 50 years.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the role of artificial intelligence in eliminating human work, Gladwell raises an important question: Is it blue-collar or white-collar work that will be replaced by artificial intelligence?</p>
          <p>He adds that he has been "hearing some very interesting predictions that focus more on the cognitive complexity of work to replace". Gladwell gave an example of a driverless truck. "Driverless cars don't make truck drivers unemployed, because truck drivers do more than just drive trucks," he said. They have to do a lot of individual tasks that require human labor motivation.</p>
          <p>Gladwell also points out that although AI can handle the part of "driving trucks," you "still need human labor to check the goods" and "make sure the trucks are working properly".</p>
          <p>On the other hand, white-collar jobs such as lawyers may actually be more dangerous to be replaced by artificial intelligence. "As we all know, the search work that lawyers need to do is simple for AI."</p>
          <p>Li Kaifu, a prominent investor who has previously worked abroad as Apple, Microsoft and Google executives, agrees with Gladwell. In an interview, Kai-fu Lee, chairman and CEO of Innovation Works, said that more than half of human jobs could be replaced by artificial intelligence in the next decade, arguably the fastest subversive phase in history. "White-collar jobs are easier to be replaced because they are purely quantitative analyses. Reporters, traders, telemarketing, telemarketing, customer service, and analysts can all be replaced by software.</p>
          <p>"As for blue-collar jobs, some require hand-eye coordination, and machines aren't good enough to do it," he added.</p>
          <p>Despite worries about the impact of automation by some tech giants, including Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, the world's top electric carmaker, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and billionaire investor Mark Cuban Like Gladwell, influential tech gurus like Eric Schmidt, a former Google executive, are more optimistic that artificial intelligence can coexist peacefully with humans at work.</p>
          <p>Musk, known as the Silicon Valley Iron Man, is probably the best known AI pessimist. Since 2014, she has been proclaiming threats to artificial intelligence, such as "We need to be extremely vigilant against artificial intelligence, which is more dangerous than nuclear weapons", "Artificial intelligence may lead to the Third World War", "Artificial intelligence is the greatest threat to human civilization" and "Artificial intelligence is an immortal dictatorship." People can never get rid of their domination, and so on.</p>
          <p>As an active supporter of artificial intelligence, Zuckerberg has repeatedly said, "Human beings are always afraid that artificial intelligence will lose control in the future and harm human beings, but we should also see that artificial intelligence can really save human life on the other hand."</p>
