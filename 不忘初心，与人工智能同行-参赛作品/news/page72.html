        <div class="two">
          <p>Harry Shum, Microsoft's only Chinese EVP (Executive Vice President, Executive Vice President), is responsible for Microsoft's medium-term and long-term strategic development, personally leading more than 5,000 AI teams. He is also the highest ranking Chinese in Microsoft's leadership structure.</p>
          <p>Academically, Shen Xiangyang is a world-class expert on computer vision and graphics. He is a member of the IEEE Fellow and ACM Fellow of the American Electrical and Electronic Engineering Association. In February 2017, Shen Xiangyang was elected academician of the American Academy of engineering.</p>

        <div class="two">
          <h3>Tan Xiaobing: it is one of Microsoft's three largest AI product lines. Next, the key technology is understanding people.</h3>
          <p>In the recent fifth generation Microsoft Xiaobing conference, Shen Xiangyang came to help. Shen Xiangyang said at the conference that every change in the age of science and technology would overthrow many things, redefining the relationship between human beings and the world. "The PC age has PC operating systems and applications; the Internet age has browsers and search engines; the mobile Internet has social networks and AppStores." Shen Xiangyang believes that IQ and EQ (IQ and EQ) are the most important things in the next era when AI comes.</p>
          <p>In Shen Xiangyang's plan, Xiaobing has become one of Microsoft's three artificial intelligence product lines (the other two are infuse AI, Bing and Xiaona). It can be seen that Microsoft pays so much attention to Xiaobing because it represents Microsoft's exploration in the field of robot EQ. Shen Xiangyang also said in the interview that the next key technology of chatting robot is understanding of people. In Shen Xiangyang's view, the machine can understand a person's words is only the basis, the key is to understand what the person is thinking, that is, "Do what I mean not what I say."</p>
          <p>"Future chat robots are self-understanding, human recognition, and can live with us." Shen Xiangyang said that the ultimate form of artificial intelligence is a body that coexists with human beings. Artificial intelligence such as Xiao Bing has coexisted with human beings and will become a trend in the future.</p>
          <h3>Talking about automatic driving: it must bring subversion, but there is still a long way to go.</h3>
          <p>As for the problem of autopilot, Shen Xiangyang replied that AI will surely subvert the entire traffic. "We have been paying much attention to the problem of autopilot, but there is still a long way to go." That is to say, in Shen Xiangyang's eyes, the matter of automatic driving, although arduous and promising, but the path twists and turns. "When it's the most difficult time, when half of the cars on the road are autopilot cars, and the other half of the cars are people's cars, how do we coordinate the traffic with the autopilot?"</p>
          <p>Microsoft's intervention in autopilot is that we have a very good relationship with all the car factories. We provide technology to it. First of all, we have cloud technology, the two is how the car can help them do it, "Shen Xiangyang said. For example, we can provide Xiaoba and Xiaobing technology to the automatic driving vehicle.</p>
          <p>Shen Xiangyang believes that Xiaobing is a good chat partner with such artificial intelligence, may have a lot of help in the process of driving. "We have a lot of technology from a platform perspective, from the cloud to AI, and we're working with them." Shen Xiangyang said.</p>
          <h3>Talk about the future: in the era of AI, Microsoft will lead the trend.</h3>
          <p>From the PC era, Microsoft used Windows to sweep the world; but to the Internet era, Microsoft is no longer the leader; to the mobile Internet era, Microsoft has fallen behind. Shen pointed out Microsoft's problems without hesitation. He also said that in the AI era, Microsoft has the ability and determination to lead the trend in the AI era if it wants to define its own weight in this era.</p>
          <p>Shen Xiangyang revealed to Netease Intelligence that when Microsoft Research Institute was established 26 years ago, the first three departments were natural language processing, speech recognition and computer vision. These are basically the most basic technology of AI perception. Shen Xiangyang believes that only a large company like Microsoft can afford long-term investment.</p>
          <p>Shen said that in the AI era, all existing Microsoft products, including Office, Cloud, Windows and other products are all artificial intelligence. The current PowerPoint, for example, has inherited machine translation, and can also use machine vision to allow the machine to see pictures and start a title.</p>
          <p>"We've seen the recent commercial value of artificial intelligence, and I think all vertical applications will definitely use artificial intelligence, including e-commerce, transportation, health care, and so on." Shen Xiangyang revealed that Microsoft will soon unveiled its products at the enterprise level of AI.</p>
          <p>Shen Xiangyang said that any great product is not a year, two or three years can do very great. Like Windows, when Windows 95 came out to dominate the world, it has been done for more than ten years.</p>
          <p>"In fact, the dialogue platform for Microsoft, the largest two dialogue platforms have been very clear, one called Xiao Bing and one called Xiao Na. All of the latter I this kind of AI technology support, can be integrated in the future, we can be in Xiaobing, Xiaona these platforms, you can use these technologies to do other things. Shen Xiangyang said so.</p>
