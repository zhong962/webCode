          <p>Some time ago I bought my father a second smartphone, a person at home for a long time, I hope he can use his smartphone to read novels, fun video, and feel bored can chat with me, video. But in fact, my wishes were mostly lost. Maybe my father was too old to play with these smart devices, to speak, to play video, to type, or even to find my avatar in a tweet. Our communication is still in the dilemma of old age.</p>
          <p>Although it is hard to accept, our parents are slowly being phased out by our increasingly intelligent society. But I still have more fantasies, maybe the technology is not advanced enough, not human enough, if smartphones can be further AI, do not need them to adapt to the tedious operation, just a voice wake up and even in the future only need a brain wave command, you can easily reach the other side of society?</p>
          <p>AI may be an opportunity for our fathers and our chance.</p>
          <p>AI is becoming ubiquitous. Around the world, there are thousands of companies involved in artificial intelligence, covering more than 10 industries in more than 60 countries. In China, top-level design, technology pursuit, land application and exploration of the three dimensions of the thrust of the tide of artificial intelligence to the top of the times.</p>
          <p>Set up a stage, singing, melon-eating people on stage ignorant of life, involvement unconsciously, in the torrent of technological iterative development, has always been so. In the tide of artificial intelligence sweeping through China, Taiwan belongs to those platforms which attack the basic technology of artificial intelligence and the technology closely related to the application of artificial intelligence. Their existence and innovative exploration are laying the foundation for the development of artificial intelligence in China. From IaaS, PaaS to SaaS, big data management and cloud computing technologies have taken root in China and gradually become the basic platform for popular services. Tencent, Ali, Baidu and Huawei are relying on their own data, algorithms, technologies and servers to build their own closed-loop industrial chains. . In the application technology dimension, machine vision, fingerprint recognition, face recognition, intelligent search, language and image understanding, genetic programming and many other fields are flourishing under the three technological routes of machine learning, pattern recognition and human-computer interaction. Sex enterprises.</p>
          <p>Singers and actresses belong to a large number of entrepreneurs and innovative enterprises flocking to artificial intelligence landing applications and scene exploration, and are in the transition from professional applications focusing on face, speech recognition, service-oriented robots and other aspects to general solutions focusing on medical, travel, smart home and other fields.</p>
          <p>To be frank, the technicalities are too dull, and discussing the vague issues of whether machines will replace humans and impact ethics seems to be a bit of a "far cry from thirst". At least in my own perception, I am more concerned about the extent to which AI can liberate our hands in the short and medium term. To what extent can AI facilitate our lives? To what extent can AI promote efficiency improvement and service upgrading? To what extent can artificial intelligence slow down our social anxiety, slow down or even improve the pace of the elderly being eliminated by the times? Wait. Can AI bring the change or life we want?</p>
          <p>A few days ago, Google Duplex was able to call hair salons, restaurants, book services and seats smoothly in the real world, and it was hard to tell whether they were real or not. The AI, which is said to have passed Turing's test, is getting closer to humans and filling us with more realistic expectations for AI's entry into everyday life.</p>
          <p>At home, Ping An Insurance is applying an AI-driven application to its lending business. Lenders need to answer questions about revenue and repayment plans in videos, just as FBIs are good at judging truth from facial expressions and body movements. To judge whether the user is telling the truth, so as to screen out the users who need further audits. It seems that the lie detector, which has not been developed for many years, will soon be replaced by AI.</p>
          <p>If we have experienced a PC era, mobile Internet era is very different, then in the era of artificial intelligence is becoming a reality, perhaps the biggest difference is the great change in human-computer interaction. Just like the smartphone AI, the advancement of human-computer interaction is liberating our hands step by step. With only basic language and simple pictures, interaction is becoming simple and efficient.</p>
          <p>As the key direction of the application of artificial intelligence, computer vision and speech semantic recognition are taking root in China, and running faster and faster on the road of commercialization, and our daily life has produced more and more close ties. In recent years, we have become accustomed to the real-time translation of sci-tech news at various forums and summits. If there is no such conference, we will not be able to adapt to it. A few days ago, Ali launched a real-time translation of AI in cross-border e-commerce, trying to break the language barriers of cross-border e-commerce. More and more scenes are being covered by AI.</p>
          <p>Baidu is also an expert in this field. ALL in AI's Baidu is building a complete ecosystem of image recognition, voice semantic recognition, from intention engine to smart hardware, from computers, mobile phones to cars, home scenes migration and expansion, Baidu is trying to complete the process from connecting information to awakening everything, in the process, regardless of the Q&amp;A dimension. Partner programs, or the Apollo program in the unmanned dimension, are involved in a large number of entrepreneurial innovation companies.</p>
          <p>With the help of Baidu AI, Qijia is trying to break through the scene of home decoration Q&amp;A and service. And in the field of automobile travel, 300 million vehicles, 200 million vehicles, 10% or more growth rate, convenient for us to travel, but also brought us numerous thorny problems with cars. Auto gurus, a start-up with Baidu AI, link 140,000 professional maintenance technicians at one end to car owners who are in urgent need of solutions, and are trying to make it easier to use cars with the dual effects of interaction and matching depth. Similar areas include education, even finance, such as Agricultural Bank of China and Mustard, where we are influenced by them and the artificial intelligence behind them in different life situations.</p>
          <p>As one of the branches of AI, the development and use of intelligent robots have become popular in China. On the unmanned warehouse and logistics front of Jingdong and Ali e-commerce giants, numerous robots are taking over the complex and time-consuming sorting and distribution work, which is efficient and not fatigued. On the track of intelligent robot, there are nearly 300 enterprises in China, among them, Youbi, Rokid, radish technology, new pine robot... Lists can be listed for a long time. These runners on the track are trying to use their own robots to meet the needs of domestic industrial development and intelligent life.</p>
          <p>There are many such examples. In fact, from voice assistants to smart speakers, from machine translation to face brushing, from medical consultation to smart home control, in the clothing, food, shelter, travel, shopping, entertainment these popular scenes, our daily life is slowly penetrated by artificial intelligence.</p>
          <p>Of course, the phenomenon of not being so comfortable is also happening. For example, in fields such as football lottery and stock market, the popularity of artificial intelligence is so fast that we are surrounded by such news as how many AI bets, how many millions of profits, how accurate stock speculation is, and so on. In such scenarios, technology has never been the most critical, but under the yoke of wealth, we often pessimistically discover that laymen are likely to have fallen so deep that technology such as artificial intelligence is nothing more than a straw.</p>
          <p>To some extent, the artificial intelligence era that humans are entering is both surprising and surprising to us and often confusing to us. But even with all the confusion and worries, I'm so eager for more AI applications to fly into "ordinary people's homes" as soon as possible, if one day, AI can ease the pain and temper of patients, and if one day, AI can let us get tired of life. Anxiety, wanton sleep; if one day, artificial intelligence can accompany the solitude of their parents who dwell in the countryside...</p>
