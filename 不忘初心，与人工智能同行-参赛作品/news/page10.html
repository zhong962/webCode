        <div class="two">
          <p>Machine learning enables computers to process tasks so far carried out solely by human beings. From driving cars to translating languages, machine learning is driving the explosive growth of artificial intelligence, helping software understand the chaotic and unpredictable real world.</p>

          <p>But what is machine learning and what makes machine learning so prosperous now?</p>
          <h3>What is machine learning?</h3>
          <p>At a high level, machine learning is the process of teaching computer systems how to make accurate predictions when feeding in data. These predictions can answer whether a fruit in a photo is a banana or an apple. It is found that the person crossing the road before the autopilot is whether the e-mail is spam or is accurate enough to identify the voice to generate the title of the YouTube video.</p>
          <p>The main difference with traditional computer software is that human developers do not write code to guide the system in how to distinguish between bananas and apples. In contrast, machine learning models accurately distinguish fruits by training large amounts of data, in which case there are large numbers of images marked as bananas or apples. </p>

        <div class="two">
          <h3>What is the difference between AI and machine learning?</h3>
          <p>Machine learning may have been a great success, but that is only one way to achieve AI. When the field of artificial intelligence was born in the 1950s, artificial intelligence was defined as any machine capable of performing tasks with human intelligence.</p>
          <p>Artificial intelligence systems usually exhibit at least one of the following features: planning, learning, reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, action and manipulation, and social intelligence and creativity.</p>
          <p>In addition to machine learning, there are various other ways to build AI systems, including evolutionary computing, where algorithms undergo random mutations and combinations between generations to try to evolve into optimal solutions. And expert systems, where computers are programmed according to rules to allow them to imitate experts in specific fields, such as the automatic driving system of aircraft.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p93.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <h3>What are the main types of machine learning?</h3>
          <p>Machine learning can be divided into two categories: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.</p>
          <p>During supervised learning training, the system is exposed to a large number of marked data, such as handwritten digital images with corresponding numbers. Given enough examples, the supervised learning system will learn to recognize the pixels and shapes associated with each number, and eventually be able to recognize handwritten numbers, and be able to reliably distribute the numbers 9 and 4 or 6 and 8.</p>
          <p>However, training these systems often requires a lot of tagged data, and some systems even need to be exposed to millions of examples to master the task.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p94.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>As a result, the dataset used to train these systems can be huge. Google's open image dataset contains about 9 million images, and its tagged video repository, YouTube-8M, can link to 7 million tagged videos. ImageNet was one of these early databases, with more than 14 million classified images. The size of the training dataset continues to grow, with Facebook recently announcing that it has edited 3.5 billion images published on Instagram and tagged them with tags for each image. In the ImageNet benchmark, 85.4% of the recordings were trained using 1 billion of these photos.</p>
          <p>The cumbersome process of tagging datasets used in training is usually done using clustering services, such as Amazon Mechanical Turks, which provide access to a large number of low-cost labor worldwide. For example, ImageNet is composed of nearly 50 thousand people in two years, mainly recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. However, the way Facebook uses publicly available data to train the system can provide another way to train the system using billions of data sets without the overhead of manual tagging.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <h3>What is unsupervised learning?</h3>
          <p>In contrast, unsupervised learning task algorithm identifies patterns in data and tries to classify similar data. For example, Epicurean brings together neighborhood rental houses, or Google News groups stories about similar topics every day.</p>
          <p>The algorithm is not designed to select specific types of data, it is only to find data that can be grouped according to their similarity, or to find data that highlights anomalies.</p>
          <h3>What is deep learning and deep neural network?</h3>
          <p>A subset of machine learning is deep learning, in which neural networks are extended to large networks with large amounts of data to train. It is these deep neural networks that promote the rapid development of computer's ability to perform speech recognition and computer vision.</p>
          <p>Various types of neural networks have different advantages and disadvantages. Recursive neural network is a kind of neural network especially suitable for language processing and speech recognition, and convolution neural network is more often used in image recognition. The design of neural networks is also evolving. Researchers have recently designed a more efficient design for effective types of deep neural networks, called long-term short-term memory or LSTM, to enable them to run quickly, such as Google translators.</p>
          <p>AI technology of evolutionary algorithm is even used to optimize neural network. This method was recently demonstrated by the Youbu Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, which published a paper on the use of genetic algorithms to train deep neural networks to reinforce learning problems.</p>

          <h3>What is machine learning used for?</h3>
          <p>Machine learning system has been around us and is the cornerstone of modern Internet. It is used to recommend products that you want to buy on Amazon or watch videos that you want to watch on Netflix.</p>
          <p>Each Google search uses multiple machine learning systems to understand the language of the query through personalized search results, so &ldquo;bass &rdquo;fishermen aren't drowned out by guitar results. Similarly, Gmail's spam and phishing recognition system uses machine-learning training models to keep your inbox away from rogue information.</p>

          <p>Virtual assistants such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's assistant and Microsoft's Cortana are typical examples of machine learning.</p>
          <p>In addition, there are many uses in many other industries, including: computer vision for unmanned vehicles and drones; speech recognition for chat and service robots; face recognition; helping radiologists pick tumors in X-rays to help researchers discover disease-related gene sequences And identify the molecules that might lead to more effective drugs in health care; analyze sensor data in the Internet of Things, allow predictive maintenance of infrastructure, and so on.</p>
