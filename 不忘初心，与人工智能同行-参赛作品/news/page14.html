          <p>The third wave of AI is coming.</p>
          <h3>From the perspective of industrial policy</h3>
          <p>Artificial intelligence has become a national strategy. In order to cope with the impact of the new scientific and technological revolution and industrial change, in 2015 the state issued "Made in China 2025", which identified five projects and ten industrial areas. And in the guiding opinions on actively promoting the "Internet + action", we clearly put forward one of the 11 industrial areas that focus on artificial intelligence. In the subsequent "Internet +" three year action plan for artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence, as an undefined general technology, is mostly confused with Internet technology.</p>
          <p>In 2016, the relevant policies began to use AI as an important tool to promote intelligent manufacturing. Until July 2017, the State Council promulgated the "New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan", indicating that artificial intelligence as a general technology in the new technological change in the role of more and more obvious, and widely recognized. In December of the same year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a three-year action plan, the Ministry of Science and Technology announced a new generation of artificial intelligence innovation platform, the Chinese Academy of Sciences established an industrial development alliance, some colleges and universities established artificial intelligence institutes, some cities began to establish artificial intelligence industrial parks... The industrial ecology of the new generation AI is beginning to mature and mature.</p>

          <h3>From the perspective of industrial transformation</h3>
          <p>Artificial intelligence is having a subversive effect. According to a study, when driverless technology began to spread across the board, 20% of the existing stock of family cars could meet the travel needs of all people, and 80% of family cars could be sealed. Intelligent driving or unmanned driving technology based on computer vision and machine learning will radically change the manufacturing and business model of the automobile industry. Unlike Tesla and Ulara Motors, industry disruptors such as Baidu, Horizon, Power Technologies and Tucson will provide users with a more comfortable and unique driving experience in a new way.</p>
          <p>At present, the AI industry has a large number of start-ups in the basic level, technology level and application level. At the basic level, the Horizon Corporation has won a lot of venture capital by playing smart chips; at the technical level, HUST has become the first batch of artificial intelligence technology innovation platforms relying on speech recognition; at the application level, visual recognition, intelligent robots, intelligent medical and other industries are developing rapidly, and some innovative solutions are being developed. In the form of formation. On the list of unicorns, we have seen a strong rise in technology and technology.</p>
          <p>In the future, AI will be displayed in front of consumers in the form of intelligent products. Intelligent technology begins to transform into products or services and quickly infiltrates into other fields. Intelligent hardware extends from wearable equipment to smart TV, smart home, smart car, medical health, smart toys, robots and other fields. With the further application of the new generation of artificial intelligence technology, the automobile will enter the era of driverless and become an intelligent mobile terminal.</p>
          <h3>Applications of artificial intelligence: production and consumption</h3>
          <p>If the application areas of artificial intelligence are divided into production and consumption, the products on the consumer side are more abundant and the schemes are more mature, mainly concentrated in the fields of finance, medical, education, security, autopilot, personal assistant, e-commerce and retail, which are closely related to people's lives. But in the field of manufacturing, artificial intelligence has not yet played a leading role in the transformation and upgrading of manufacturing industry. Intelligent manufacturing platforms built by some domestic enterprises are called "the third pole" different from industrial 4.0 and industrial Internet.</p>
          <p>In the manufacturing process, with artificial intelligence breaking through the bottleneck in machine vision, speech recognition and natural language recognition, industrial robot technology and its application will be more mature, and industrial robot with higher precision and flexibility will be applied in all aspects of the manufacturing process. Unlike simple assembly lines, machine vision systems control robot trajectories based on what they see.</p>
          <p>The penetration of artificial intelligence technology in the field of manufacturing makes the production, acquisition, application and inheritance of knowledge and skills change from Human-oriented to human-computer collaboration, and ultimately to intelligent machines as the main body. Its efficiency can be fundamentally changed, and manufacturing innovation capability can be greatly improved.</p>
          <p>Under the new generation of intelligent manufacturing paradigm, manufacturing process and R&amp;D, supply chain, users and other links can achieve a high degree of coordination, change the past value chain links of the "island" state, so as to organize production more effectively, more accurately adapt to user needs. But artificial intelligence as a general technology, only at the same time in production and demand at both ends of the force, the application of artificial intelligence in intelligent factories, and constantly create intelligent ecology, can completely change the status quo of Chinese manufacturing, truly push Chinese manufacturing to the commanding heights of the global value chain, leading the global industrial transformation.</p>
