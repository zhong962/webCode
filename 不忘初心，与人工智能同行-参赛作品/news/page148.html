         <p>EPAT Technology Limited (ASX: PET) is an Australian medical technology company dedicated to the development of accurate and effective pain assessment equipment to help patients unable to communicate with doctors normally express feelings. The company is currently developing, and has made breakthroughs in the product - ePAT software, can be used to identify facial microexpressions, accurately assess and communicate the degree of pain patients. Under the current medical technology level, there is still a lack of an objective and accurate measurement of pain, mostly by asking patients or questionnaire evaluation, this method can only get patients'intuitive feelings, subjective and inaccurate, which is very disadvantageous to medical diagnosis. Besides, it should be built on the basis of normal communication with patients. For patients with Alzheimer's disease, or for infants and young children, doctors are even less aware. To fill this gap, ePAT developed two software for these two groups of people. Software for infants and young children will be completed in the fourth quarter of this year algorithm design, database accumulation, next year formally entered the stage of research and development and clinical trials, if positive results are achieved, is expected to start the second half of next year government approval (Europe, Australia) and commercial promotion. The software for Alzheimer's disease has been successfully developed and has completed clinical trials and feasibility tests. The results are very optimistic. In the third quarter of this year, it will enter the European and Australian medical device approval stage, and is expected to be fully promoted in the Australian market in the fourth quarter.</p>
         <p>The approval process for entering the US market will also begin in 2018. After approval, ePAT software will also be divided into Android system and IOS system, sold separately. Android system software will cooperate with Google Play to sell directly to individuals. On the one hand, the IOS software is available to the public through Apple's official stores, on the other hand, it will also work with third-party software vendors to mass-supply geriatric care centers and nursing homes. At present, the company's main partners are nViso, Darwin Digital and Curtin University. Combining nViso's facial recognition technology with Darwin Digital's Alzheimer's Nursing Software and Back-end Processing System, together with the research and development of Curtin University and human resources support, all parties work together to provide a most simple and practical product for the vast number of patients. The target market group of ePAT software is very large. Around 47 million Alzheimer's patients worldwide are still growing at a 3% annual rate, with more than 400,000 in Australia alone. In geriatric care centers, more than 50% of the elderly have different degrees of dementia symptoms, about 85% of patients often have pain. If nurses can not accurately understand the physical condition of the elderly, it will have a great negative impact on the quality of life of the elderly and the treatment effect of the disease. About 1.25 million children under three in Australia are likely to experience pain from measles, otitis media, brain disease, and digestive problems, but they are difficult to detect. The advantage of ePAT software is obvious, using artificial intelligence technology, by capturing and analyzing the patient's facial expressions, to judge the real-time perception of pain patients.</p>
         <p>With three seconds of facial expression data, it can be automatically analyzed, and can accurately distinguish the pain types represented by the nine microexpressions. Matched with questionnaires for caregivers, collect external signs of patients, including action, voice, etc., comprehensive analysis, to make an accurate assessment of patients'pain. On the one hand, it can save time, get more accurate results, help nurses to understand the physical condition of patients more accurately without professional guidance; on the other hand, it can give accurate answers directly through software analysis, reduce the need for patients to seek medical treatment, save costs, and record the daily physical condition of patients. This will provide more information for the future diagnosis of doctors. The Australian Stock Exchange's latest price is 0.043 Australian dollars.</p>
