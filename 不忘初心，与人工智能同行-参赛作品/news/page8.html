        <h1 class="title">Analysis of the latest AI layout of the seven Giants: intense competition in the field of AI</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>In recent years, the development and application of artificial intelligence technology in the world are advancing by leaps and bounds. For example, automotive testing is in full swing at major companies, many people use AI assistants like Alexa at home every day, Watson AI is being used in disease research and diagnosis, and AI investment advisors have led to layoffs at financial companies...</p>
          <p>While we still have to wait for some truly exciting breakthroughs, the AI platform projects currently being developed by seven technology giants, including Google, Amazon, Apple and Intel, give us a glimpse of the dazzling changes ahead.</p>
          <p>Of course, on the other hand, competition among giants is also a platform competition. From the layout of these seven companies, we can also see the competitive situation of these enterprises in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
          <h2>1．Google: making AI easier to access and less dangerous</h2>
          <p>Some time ago, Gu Ge was criticized for participating in the development of AI weapons. After strong protests from the public, the company decided to reassess their AI methods. In June, Google issued a set of guidelines setting out its commitment to the development of moral artificial intelligence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p71.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Recently, the company launched a cloud-based artificial intelligence platform that allows developers to use container-wrapped software applications and access the tools they need anytime, anywhere.</p>
          <p>All this is the result of Google's powerful voice interaction and AI interaction. On the one hand, Google is competing fiercely with Amazon, Microsoft and other companies, on the other hand, it is doing its utmost to develop and deliver a variety of AI to meet the needs of multiple use scenarios.</p>
          <h2>2．Amazon: expanding the scope of Amazon's Web Services</h2>
          <p>Like Google, Amazon is working to develop cloud-based AI services and make it easier for developers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p72.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>In 2017, the company launched the Amazon SageMaker service, which aims to create a development framework that allows companies to integrate machine learning into their new applications faster. Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed end-to-end machine learning service that allows data scientists, developers, and machine learning experts to quickly build, train, and run large-scale machine learning models.</p>
          <p>At the recent AWS summit, the company unveiled new computing services available on its cloud platform, as well as their recent efforts in machine learning.</p>
          <p>The company announced that the improved SageMaker service enables developers to build and test applications in the cloud. The introduction of the SageMaker stream algorithm means that developers will be able to transfer large amounts of data and effectively train custom machine learning applications.</p>
          <h2>3．Apple: improving Siri and catching up</h2>
          <p>Despite Apple's popularity, the AI sector has been lagging behind rivals, and Siri and other AI project development industries have not yet reached the level of data that Google and Amazon advertise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p73.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>However, this may be about to change. In early July, Apple's core machine learning team ushered in John Giannandrea, Google's former AI director, as their machine learning and AI strategy director, who will report directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook.</p>
          <p>This is just one of Apple Corp's many measures to enhance AI competitiveness. In 2017, Apple acquired several AI startups, including Israel's face recognition technology company RealFace and Germany's eye tracking technology company Senso Motoric. Both acquisitions indicate that Apple is moving into a more advanced and intuitive AI platform that will enable the company to catch up with its competitors.</p>
          <h2>4．Intel: promote AI in automatic driving, medical and other fields.</h2>
          <p>In recent years, Intel's attitude towards AI has become very clear. To promote its AI strategy, the company cooperated with China's technology giant Baidu to develop artificial intelligence for self driving cars.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p74.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>In early July, at the Baidu AI developer conference, Intel announced a deep cooperation with Baidu to participate in the Baidu Apollo autopilot project and decided to use the responsibility sensitive safety (RSS) model.</p>
          <p>Intel is also working with Samsung to explore the possibility of using AI in healthcare applications to create an AI that can study different diseases and even detect tumors.</p>
          <p>In addition, Intel and Forbes have jointly created a digital publication focusing on AI-based journalism.</p>
          <h2>5．IBM: use AI to treat cancer and debate with humans.</h2>
          <p>In the past two years, IBM has made many headlines with revolutionary AI Watson. At present, Watson has been used for self driving cars and daily business activities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p75.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>As part of Watson Health, IBM works with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to develop treatment plans for cancer patients based on their specific genomic data.</p>
          <p>Launched in 2016, the Watson application has shown the benefits of using artificial intelligence in medical environments, especially in compiling and evaluating data, which is much faster than any human medical professional.</p>
          <p>In June, IBM's latest AI System Project Debater defeated the top human debater in a debate. Project Debater has no clear business goals, but its impressive technology presentation is another good example of IBM's layout in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
          <h2>6．Ford: promoting smart city and intelligent driving development</h2>
          <p>Ford is one of the earliest traditional automobile manufacturers to transform into a "car and mobile travel company".</p>
          <p>As early as early as 2012, Ford put forward a "mobile travel blueprint" and at the North American Auto Show in early 2017, the company presented a vision of a "future city" designed to encourage innovation and help cities cope with the challenges of mobile travel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p76.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Earlier this year, Ford announced that it would further promote the development of smart cities and explore new auto-driving applications through a variety of AI and smart technologies, and that it had already partnered with City Express Postmates, Qualcomm and Autonomic.</p>
          <p>In the plan, Ford launched a traffic travel cloud platform developed by Ford and Autonomic to track real-time urban data and effectively coordinate all vehicles, citizens and traffic lights.</p>
          <p>Recently, Ford announced the purchase of Detroit's abandoned Michigan Central Railway Station, and plans to build automated driving and electric vehicle innovation platforms here. This move is a step closer to Ford's idea of smart city.</p>
          <h2>7．Microsoft: save the environment through AI</h2>
          <p>In July, Microsoft announced a partnership with National Geographic to fund global environmental research and launched a $1 million "AI for Earth InnovaTIon Grant" program that allows data scientists to use Microsoft's cloud services and AI tools.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
          <img src="./pimg/p77.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Five to fifteen recipients will be selected for projects covering biodiversity conservation, climate change, agriculture or water resources research, each of which will be funded under $200,000. In addition, all AI models built with resources obtained through grant schemes need to be shared open source so that other researchers can continue to study them.</p>
          <p>In addition, Microsoft recently released information on Dynamics 365 AI. This is a new generation of Microsoft Cloud Intelligent Business Applications, through the integration of CRM and ERP software to help enterprises achieve digital transformation. Although Microsoft is not as focused on individual consumers as its competitors are, Microsoft's latest AI initiatives undoubtedly prove the rapid spread of the technology in different industries and fields.</p>
