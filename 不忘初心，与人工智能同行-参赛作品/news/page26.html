          <p>DeepMind belongs to Alphabet's AI department. DeepMind announced the open source DeepMind laboratory on Monday. The DeepMind lab is DeepMind's 3D gaming platform for agent based AI research.</p>
          <p>DeepMind's team said in a blog post that the 3D world was viewed from the first person perspective and that it would be easier to develop generic intelligence in the 3D world. General Intelligence is the ability to adapt to changing environments and operate in unprogrammed environments.</p>
          <p>After all, the only known example of universal intelligence in the natural world originates from the physical and sensory aspects of animals, and is a combination of evolution, development and learning. Much of the animal and human intelligence is likely to be the direct result of enriching the environment, which is unlikely to occur without the environment. "</p>
          <p>Agents in DeepMind's lab appear as "individuals" of floating objects whose thrusters are activated and can float around. DeepMind Lab Platform focuses on navigation, memory, one-person angle 3D vision, motor control, planning, strategy and time management. Users can use resources on GitHub to add new customization layers to the platform, including functions such as game logic and reward schemes, and the layout of dynamically generated novel maps during proxy training.</p>
          <p>In addition, the non-profit AI company OpenAI, built by Elon Musk, Amazon Web Services and other vendors, has announced the launch of a software platform called Universe, which can test and train AI's general intelligence in games, websites and other applications. Universe can transform all kinds of programs into a training environment that supports Gym. Gym is the OpenAI Open Source Toolkit, which can be used to develop and compare various reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>
          <p>"Our goal is to develop a single intelligent agent that can flexibly apply its past experience in the Universe environment and quickly control unfamiliar difficult environments, which will be a major step in the field of general intelligence," OpenAI said in its blog post. "</p>
          <p>The OpenAI team explained that agents in Universe operate remote desktops by looking at the pixels on the screen and generating keyboard and mouse commands. Universe runs the program behind the VNC remote desktop, and its library turns the proxy into a VNC client. The new release contains thousands of environments, including Flash games, browser tasks such as slither. io, and games. In addition, OpenAI has been licensed by EA, Microsoft Studios, Valve, Wolfram and other vendors, allowing Universe AI agents to access many games and applications.</p>
