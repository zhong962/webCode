        <h1 class="title">Artificial intelligence talent gap exceeds 5 million Internet companies dig millions of annual salary</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Recently, the global mobile Internet Conference Beijing Railway Station opened. Tom Mitchell, Dean of machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Sciences, analyzed the trends in artificial intelligence, and artificial intelligence talent became the focus of attention.</p>
          <p>China has become one of the development centers of artificial intelligence in the world, but it faces enormous talent gap. Some media commented that "China and the United States will become the fastest growing countries in the field of artificial intelligence, and China has quietly begun to"overtake". "Competition in industry is essentially a competition in basic education. It is an inevitable trend for colleges and universities to train and convey the counterpart professionals needed by the society.</p>
          <p>What is AI? Artificial Intelligence, abbreviated as AI. It is a new technical science to study and develop the theory, method, technology and application system of human intelligence for simulation, extension and extension. That is to say, artificial intelligence is the simulation of the information process of human consciousness and thinking, to achieve the ability to think like human beings, or to exceed human intelligence, through the machine to replace some usually need human intelligence to complete complex work.</p>

          <p>According to LinkedIn China data analysis, the number of AI talents registered on the platform in 2016 was about 250,000, mainly in the United States, Europe, India and China. At present, the 10 countries with the largest number of AI related professionals are: the United States, Britain, India, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Australia, Brazil, China.</p>

          <p>According to network statistics, the top five universities contributing to AI are: Harbin University of Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China University of Science and Technology, Zhejiang University; the graduate students of AI talents in China are the main ones, accounting for 60%, reflecting the cross-disciplinary theory involved in the industry. The requirements for qualified personnel are higher; undergraduate degree is 3, and doctorate ratio is half finished, ranking third.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence research includes robots, language recognition, image recognition and so on. Sun Lining, director of the Robotics Research Institute of Harbin University of Technology and father of robots, once said, "According to the current growth rate of robot installation in China, the demand for talent has been in a state of thirst for a long time. "How big is the gap between robot operators in China? In 2016, Zhou Ming, deputy director of the Education and Examination Center of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, revealed to the media that the gap exceeded 5 million people. If we do not speed up training, we will drag the country's intelligence.</p>
          <p>After sorting out found that Tencent, Ali, Baidu and other large companies, are high-paid recruitment of talent in this area, the annual salary to 60 weeks is normal. "It's normal for engineers who have graduated for three years and are able to play with their advanced studies to make headlines today, with annual salaries ranging from 70 to 80 weeks," according to AI field start-ups. "We can see that Internet Co is willing to spend heavily on the exploitation of AI talents.</p>
          <p>As soon as possible for China's future artificial intelligence industry to train a large number of highly educated, high-quality professionals, has become an urgent task for China's education industry. The reason for this phenomenon is largely due to the long training cycle and the lack of a relatively perfect talent training mechanism.</p>
          <p>Reporters in the process of combing, noted that science and Technology Daily reported this. On February 18, a strategic seminar on the development of Engineering Education in comprehensive universities was held in Fudan University. Participants discussed in depth how to train new engineering and technical personnel with higher innovation and entrepreneurship ability and cross-border integration ability under the current situation of vigorous development of the new economy characterized by new technology, new formats and new industries. More than 30 universities, including Peking University and Nanjing University, participated in the meeting and reached a consensus on the construction of ten "new subjects".</p>
          <p>On February 23, the Ministry of Education issued the Notice of the Department of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education (hereinafter referred to as the Notice) on the Development of "New Subjects" Research and Practice. The professional settings of "New Subjects" will take the Internet and industrial intelligence as the core, and then integrate into other similar science and technology disciplines, such as artificial intelligence, intelligent manufacturing, robotics, and so on. Cloud computing also includes upgrading and upgrading of traditional engineering majors.</p>

          <p>The Ministry of Education recently issued a "circular" is hoping that colleges and universities can cultivate more talents in artificial intelligence, to make up for the enterprise's desire for talent, the cooperation between enterprises and colleges and universities to build a channel to cultivate artificial intelligence talent. On April 20, Huike Group, together with Microsoft, Aliyun, Baidu and other partners, released the first "AI +" education solution in China. This program mainly provides different levels of personnel training system, teaching programs, laboratory and supporting environment construction programs, as well as online and offline integration of vocational training programs. The course content takes artificial intelligence as the core, and combines with cloud computing, large data, intelligent hardware and other fields, emphasizing the application of artificial intelligence in various industries.</p>
          <p>In order to promote the "AI+" education solution, Dalian University of Technology, South China University of Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Shanxi Agricultural University, Beijing City College and other six well-known universities, as well as Huike Group's opening bar vocational training module, has become the first batch in China. Schools and institutions that use this educational solution.</p>
          <p>With the development of the market, artificial intelligence (AI) has replaced the substitutable labor force, but at the same time, it has also brought more talents to operate AI. Therefore, how can colleges and universities improve the personnel training mechanism of relevant disciplines as soon as possible, set up corresponding majors, cultivate high-quality personnel to effectively link up the contingent, and provide the necessary personnel for the society has become a problem to be solved.</p>
