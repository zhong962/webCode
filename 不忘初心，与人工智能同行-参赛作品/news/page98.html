        <h1 class="title">What surprises does the "Ai Hua Tuo" bring to the industry?</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>In recent years, artificial intelligence has become a hot topic, and the innovation of AI technology is changing all aspects of people's lives, according to the Voice of China News. Especially in the medical field, this year, from medical imaging, auxiliary diagnosis and treatment to health management, virtual assistants, medical chain in all aspects of the emergence of artificial intelligence technology. Artificial intelligence and hand in hand in medical field also send gospel to doctors and patients.</p>
          <p>At present, the advancement of AI technology in the medical field has attracted the attention and attention of all walks of life at home and abroad. Many enterprises and scientific research institutions have begun to accelerate the layout of intelligent medical field. From the domestic point of view, Baidu, Ali, Tencent three with a deep background in the use of large data began in the medical field in short succession. Since Baidu launched "Baidu Medical Brain" last year, Ali and Tencent have also been reluctant to show weakness, and have launched artificial intelligence products in the medical field this year. What surprises does the "modern Hua Tuo" with massive data storage capabilities bring to the industry?</p>
          <p>Baidu launched the Baidu medical brain in October 2016. Three months ago, the AI Doctor You, developed by Ali Health, was officially released, and the two "brains" ultimately point to the role of future doctor assistants. Following this, Tencent announced its first medical AI product, Tencent Find Shadow, in August this year, making early esophageal cancer screening the first to enter clinical trials.</p>
          <p>Ali Health Senior Architecture Teachers deductive introduction, lung nodule detection as an example, with the help of artificial intelligence technology, can greatly improve the efficiency of doctors. For example, almost every 9,000 images is done in 30 minutes, and traditionally it takes about four doctors 50 to 180 minutes. If the machine is 5-6 times the former, the accuracy rate is more than 90%.</p>
          <p>Fan Yi said that technology can be used as a supplement to help doctors overcome difficulties encountered in their work. "First of all, doctors may have fatigue and lack of energy. Machines do not have this problem. Second, by some means of AI, to help doctors do the screening, the intensity of work will be reduced, the efficiency of the human body will be improved.</p>
          <p>In addition, such technology also began to step out of the laboratory, slowly into ordinary hospitals, set up in Anhui Provincial Hospital artificial intelligence medical imaging auxiliary diagnosis system for lung imaging diagnostic accuracy rate of 94%, has a third-class hospital doctors diagnostic level of breast cancer and lung cancer, Anhui Provincial Hospital imaging deputy director Doctor Wei Wei said, "No. 2 nodules like this are very easy to be missed in CT imaging, but the system is very sensitive detection, and the system can also determine the maximum diameter, volume and CT value of nodules, to make a preliminary judgment of its benign and malignant."</p>
          <p>At present, Anhui Provincial Hospital Intelligent Medical Application Platform is gradually docking with the urban medical consortium, County medical consortium and other platforms to achieve remote medical consultation, hierarchical diagnosis and treatment, online consultation, chronic disease management. Liu Qingfeng, chairman of the Information Flight of the University of Science and Technology, said that artificial intelligence technology can help doctors to improve efficiency, but also can be raised. High level of primary health care in China. Artificial intelligence can improve the work efficiency of the excellent doctors in the Third-Class A Hospital, and also enable the doctors at the grass-roots level to obtain the advice and guidance from the experts to improve the level of diagnosis and treatment. This will greatly improve the current situation of insufficient medical resources and uneven distribution of high-quality medical resources in China.</p>
          <p>However, the intervention of artificial intelligence can alleviate the pressure of doctors and improve the diagnosis and treatment experience of patients, but there are still many people in the field of artificial intelligence and medical hand-in-hand skepticism.</p>
          <p>Whether doctors will be unemployed as a result of this is still a cliche, questioned, but the developers stress that there is no substitute. Fan explained to reporters that the current goal of AI + medicine is still to help doctors and alleviate the "difficulty" of seeing a doctor. "Hopefully, through the intervention of AI resources and tools, doctors will be able to handle more medical settings and the number of patients serving, which is a core direction at present."</p>
          <p>However, with the development of artificial intelligence technology in the medical field, some people call it "modern Huatuo" and compare the changes it can bring with the industrial revolution, which can have a tremendous impact and challenge on the whole social system. Especially the big data that artificial intelligence depends on, is the focal point that each platform company contends for. The so-called "the world has data," but after all, human health data is different from other, how to protect, has also been put on the agenda of discussion.</p>
          <p>Wang Yue, an Internet expert, believes that "the data involved are more sensitive and related to people's life and health. History tells us that if we only rely on a company or a large platform, even if it is a very social ethics, professional ethics of business enterprises, after all, it is for profit purposes, certainly in the internal user protection can not keep pace with the pursuit of profit, so in the development of artificial intelligence medicine, the government related opportunities Institutions and policymakers should learn from the experience of the new economic development before, first consider how to formulate the corresponding standards and safeguard mechanisms.</p>
          <p>It's not just big data, though there are still some uncertainties about the future of artificial intelligence, even ethical and legal issues, but maybe one day we can imagine a future in which robots will automatically examine themselves when their bodies feel uncomfortable and produce detailed and accurate analysis reports and diagnoses immediately. Suggestions. And this may not be far away from us.</p>
