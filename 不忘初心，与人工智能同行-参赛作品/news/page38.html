        <div class="two">
          <p>Everyone knows that artificial intelligence is important, but many people don't know how important it is; many people worry that artificial intelligence will take the place of human work, but they don't know that artificial intelligence can create a lot of work; many people fear that artificial intelligence will eventually dominate the earth, but they may not know artificial. Intelligence is just a machine. There are no genes, no emotions, no love or hate, no personal preferences.</p>

          <h3>In fact, what is AI?</h3>
          <p>In order to understand AI correctly, we must first define the definition of "intelligence". Artificial intelligence can not simply be called a technology, but a method of using technology, which is characterized by imitating human capabilities. It involves all the technologies available at present, such as computer vision, cloud computing, big data, machine learning and so on.</p>
          <p>There is a buzzword in the industry that "data determines the upper limit of machine learning, and algorithms are just as close to that limit as possible." The data here refer to data obtained through feature engineering. Feature engineering refers to the process of transforming the original data into training data of the model. Its purpose is to obtain better training data features and make machine learning model approach this upper limit. Traditional machine learning methods require people to design and input the knowledge they want to learn on the computer, because they need to master a large number of professional knowledge, resulting in feature engineering become the bottleneck of machine learning. Deep learning breaks this bottleneck. It filters and extracts the "features" of the data set through multi-layer structure algorithm, and finds the differences and rules through repeated training. Finally, it obtains the ability to extract Abstract concepts.</p>

          <h3>AI is a tool, not a master.</h3>
          <p>Artificial intelligence has reflected the progress of science and technology in many aspects. Driverless cars, for example, are the crystals of artificial intelligence that allow passengers to get from one point to another in the shortest possible time without worrying about the greater risk of accidents than cars driven by someone. But perhaps we don't take into account that some people drive not necessarily to get to their destination quickly, but to wander aimlessly around the river, or to enjoy the scenery slowly, or to have fun driving. These are all unattended cars that have not been taken into account.</p>
          <p>In addition, we can see that artificial intelligence is reflected in improving enterprise efficiency. Amazon's personalized recommendations and Allxa, Apple's Sili, advertising ideas, media delivery, and the growing Internet of Things and Smart Cities are all AI products. Even in the future we will land on Mars, to study the mysteries of outer space, artificial intelligence must occupy an important position, because they are adaptable, and will not be sick, do not eat, will not be tired. Their characteristics are that they can improve and iterate throughout the day by learning and adjusting. Today's Alpha Go, the only opponent must be another Alpha Go, because the machine's learning speed and volume are not human beings can catch up with.</p>

          <h3>AI in China</h3>
          <p>China's R &amp; D and investment in artificial intelligence have developed rapidly and achieved remarkable results. Maybe five years ago, China was not considered a big country of artificial intelligence, but today, the world is aware of the rapid rise of artificial intelligence in China.</p>
          <p>Among the current hot technologies of artificial intelligence, the most powerful should be computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation system and network security. Natural language technology is one of the core technologies of AI, and its development is inseparable from Chinese. Therefore, China's artificial intelligence technology can be applied to the huge domestic market through products, algorithms and data. China has 1 billion 400 million people, more than half of whom are Internet users. This will generate massive data sources and form a huge test ground. Some start-ups have been able to use huge databases to develop machine learning, and large amounts of data can support them in algorithm learning, to a level that no American company of the same size can reach. Data is wealth, so China has a unique advantage in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <h3>Will we be replaced by artificial intelligence in the future?</h3>
          <p>All along, the development of AI has been criticized. Many people are concerned about the safety and moral values of AI. Indeed, we have countless unknowns about AI. But we should also believe in ourselves, because artificial intelligence does not exist out of the human logic. For example, mathematics, philosophy, psychology and so on.</p>
          <p>Now there is a study of machine morality in the world. Whether or not we can correctly judge the truth of artificial intelligence depends on our own set of artificial intelligence. For my part, I never made artificial intelligence independent of human work, I just made artificial intelligence that works with humans. Because I believe that artificial intelligence, which is divorced from human needs, has deviated from its own value of existence.</p>
          <p>We should think of them as "comrades in arms" or "tools" to assist us in our work. AI is most useful when it comes to our partners. It is not a substitute for human labor. As mentioned earlier, the future of human beings still occupies the top of the thinking capacity, and the role of human beings as managers and controllers is still important. Just as a great deal of labor force has been separated from traditional agriculture and handicraft industry, and new jobs have been found in modern industrial production and urban service industries, so will the progress of artificial intelligence. Many areas that extend from the current data-intensive machine learning, through machine learning and artificial intelligence conversation systems, will bring many job opportunities in the future.</p>
          <p>Perhaps one day, the power of artificial intelligence will surpass our imagination, and no one can estimate it. But it's not unlike the emergence of steam engines, electricity, the Internet, and so on. Humans always have the upper hand, because we have soul life. As long as we are determined to become masters of our destiny, any scientific and technological revolution will only make mankind more civilized, more advanced and more progressive.</p>
