          <p>In March 5, 2018, Premier Li Keqiang pointed out in the 2018 State Council's government work report that we should strengthen the research and application of the new generation of artificial intelligence, promote the "Internet +" in the fields of health care, pension, education, culture, sports and other fields, develop intelligent industries and expand intelligent life.</p>
          <p>This is not the first time that artificial intelligence has entered the "Government Work Report". In the government work report of 2017, the Premier mentioned that "on the one hand, we should accelerate the cultivation of new materials, artificial intelligence, integrated circuits, biopharmaceuticals, the fifth generation of mobile communications and other emerging industries, on the other hand, we should apply large data, cloud computing, Internet of Things, and so on." We should accelerate the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, and develop intelligent manufacturing as the main direction of attack.</p>
          <p>Two consecutive years of government work reports mention artificial intelligence, can be seen in the artificial intelligence has become an important driving force for the development of science and technology in today's environment, the government's determination to raise artificial intelligence to the national will.</p>

          <h3>2018: artificial intelligence local level policy year</h3>
          <p>According to the summary of the Institute of Prospective Industry Research, only in the first three months of 2018, six provinces and cities, including Guangdong, Tianjin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Fujian and Sichuan, issued artificial intelligence plans. In addition, the provinces and cities that issued policies last year, by March 2018, 15 provinces and municipalities in China have issued artificial intelligence plans, of which 12 have formulated specific industrial scale development goals.</p>
