        <h1 class="title">Jurgen: AI has long been conscious of where the industry will go in the next ten years</h1>
        <div class="two">
          <p>JU rgen Schmidhuber is absolutely a strange name in China's artificial intelligence industry. Even for AI practitioners all over the world, he is also a very low-key technology elder. Living and working in Switzerland, although far from the two noisy centers of the United States and China, the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) time recurrent neural network invented by Jurgen has been popular in artificial intelligence research all over the world.</p>
          <p>Jurgen is currently director of science at the Swiss Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (IDSIA) and teaches at the University of Lugano and the School of Applied Sciences and Arts in Southern Switzerland. As the first Fellow of the International Association of Computational Languages (ACL), Yu Ergen has made great achievements in machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing. He co-founded LSTM with Sepp Hochreiter and laid the foundation for the success of recurrent neural networks in ORC, speech recognition and other applications today.</p>
          <p>For the industry's long-awaited "general AI" (AGI), Yu Ergen believes that AI can usually connect AI with human characteristics such as consciousness, emotion, knowledge and consciousness, and one of the most critical issues is that it is not subject to designer constraints. General AI systems are moving towards reality, which means that some AI systems are already conscious. Jurgen's study found that agents create a signal to compress all the behaviors around them. The most effective way is to find a signal or a small subnetwork to replace themselves, including all the actions, the results and so on. It can be aware of itself, present itself and self-feedback, and compress observation history in unsupervised model networks.</p>
          <p>For a long time, why do people think artificial intelligence is unconsciousness? Juergen explained that this is because the consciousness system of the agent is still very simple, with only a few hundred connections. This is very few compared with the human consciousness system with billions of connections. However, this is only a quantitative difference, and the quality is the same.</p>
          <p>"If we build a system in the future that has more connections than the human brain, consciousness will be a byproduct of data compression, and there's no need to write some everyday awareness to the agent, because the agent will become aware with the data compression." Jurgen said.</p>
          <p>In the man-machine battle DeepMind waged in China last month, Yu Ergen said Alphago, which is used to compete, is not a universal artificial intelligence because it is only used to deal with specific problems, does not require complete human cognitive ability, or even does not have the human sensory cognitive ability at all. But DeepMind has been working on general AI, because many of its founders came from Ergen's early labs, and Ergen began working on it in 1987.</p>
          <p>As for the development of artificial intelligence in the next 10 years, Jurgen said, artificial intelligence will have many applications in different fields. At the same time, artificial intelligence will have more perfect systems, better control, and hopefully become easier to understand human thinking, understand human thinking, and provide better advice and help to human beings. Help can better communicate with human beings.</p>
          <p>To facilitate the implementation of a universal artificial intelligence system, in 2014, Jurgen and four researchers he worked with at the Swiss Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence co-founded Nnaisense, the company's vision is to "promote artificial intelligence based on universal neural networks."</p>

          <h3>AlphaGo is not universal AI, because it does not have complete consciousness and emotion</h3>
          <p>Reporter: how do you think of AlphaGo and Kirk's human-machine war? Some people say that AlphaGo has reached the level of development of general AI (AGI). Do you agree with it?</p>
          <p>Jurgen: first of all, I am very interested in this competition. Because I've been working on General Artificial Intelligence since 1987 and published my first article on General Artificial Intelligence in the same year. That's an article about machine learning, especially how to learn, so that humans have no limitations in learning, but it's not just about how to enhance brain areas that control behavior. I studied for a long time, and although the results were not obvious, my student Cyp Hockles contributed a lot to Deep Mind. At the same time, one of the founders of Deep Mind, Shane Legge, also studied superintelligence in my lab. In fact, when Mustafa Suleiman, one of the founders of DeepMind, founded the company, he also studied biological neuroscience. DeepMind is closely related to AGI, and I have deep roots in AGI.</p>
          <p>But I don't think Alpha Go is showing "general AI" in this man-machine war. In 1990s, we already had a basic conscious learning system. At that time, I proposed that the general learning system should contain two modules. One is a cyclic network controller, in which machines learn to receive data and then convert it into action. This network can learn to convert all these inputs into action sequences in time. Since 1990, our agents have been trying to do the same thing, using an additional loop network (an unsupervised module) to predict what will happen.</p>
          <p>I don't think AlphaGo (at least for the time being) is a general AI because it's only used to deal with specific problems, and it doesn't need to have the full cognitive power of humans, or even the sensory cognitive power of humans, but it just looks like wisdom. In Go, Alpha Go only needs to analyze the board with nineteen equidistant, perpendicularly crossed parallel lines, to decide where to play next, and to focus on this matter, regardless of the environment. It doesn't need to think about the history of Go, the stories and emotions behind it, which is different from real life. In real life, human contact with the world around countless, even so, human can not see all the meaning behind. The human brain has so much to do that you need to remember what you said and did last time, but Alpha Go doesn't need to, and doesn't need to give feedback. So, I don't think Alphago, which is used in Go games, is really "general AI" in our sense.</p>
          <p>What is the so-called "general AI"? AGI usually connects AI to human traits such as consciousness, emotion, knowledge and consciousness, and one of the key issues is that it is not limited by designers!</p>
          <h3>AI has long been conscious that it can compress data only with too few connection points.</h3>
          <p>Reporter: do you think some AI systems are already "conscious"?</p>
          <p>Jurgen: Yes, I think some artificial intelligence has been conscious now. As early as the early 1990s, AI had already had some simple ideas. At that time, I published an article on artificial intelligence consciousness, which is very simple. Do you know how human beings set up consciousness system? We have a lot of agents that predict future events based on past events. The more efficient way to do this is to compress the data, so it's important to build a small network. How do we build small networks? It's about connecting with the world around you, automatically building a sub-network that represents some typical impressions that are repeated over and over in your brain. For example, face recognition, you will encounter many different faces in life, if you establish a network system, when you meet new faces, there will be some differences between the new face and the original face in the brain, the brain will automatically record these differences, so as to identify new faces, which is very efficient.</p>
          <p>Another important thing about consciousness is that in the process of interaction between an agent and the world around him, he is always aware of his own existence. In the process of recognition, an agent will create a signal to compress all the behaviors around it. The most effective way is to find a signal or a small sub-network to replace itself, including all the actions, the results and so on. It can be aware of itself, present itself and self-feedback, and compress observation history in unsupervised model networks.</p>
          <p>The ultimate goal of agents is to maximize happiness and minimize pain. This controller can solve the problem through the network model. For example, it is difficult to choose the best solution to a problem. Why choose one solution instead of the other? One solution leads to happiness and the other to pain. Because all living things tend to benefit and avoid harm, conscious AI can choose the one leading to happiness. Solutions. In the process of solving this problem, agents consider themselves by establishing some sub signals. For a long time, why people think artificial intelligence is unconscious, because the consciousness system of an agent is very simple, with only a few hundred connections. This is very few compared with the human consciousness system with billions of connections. However, this is only a quantitative difference, and the quality is the same.</p>
          <p>To a certain extent, we have the same principle, which explains that if we build a system in the future that has more connections than the human brain, consciousness will be a byproduct of data compression, and there's no need to write some everyday awareness to the agent, because the agent will have business with data compression. Knowledge.</p>
          <h3>AI companies all over the world are using LSTM, but this is only a small part of AI.</h3>
          <p>Reporter: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network is very popular in artificial intelligence research, and is used in many companies and areas of research and development, can you give some examples? As a founder, will you update and improve LSTM in the future?</p>
          <p>Jurgen: as far as I know, LSTM is used by Google to track millions of Android phones. At the same time, Google has introduced new technologies, and Google translation has made great progress. Previously, when Google translation was not perfect, Chinese people would joke about the results of translation, such as in the process of Chinese-English translation, because the system is not perfect, it will produce ridiculous translation results. Google translation has changed a lot now, because it's built on LSTM and has made great progress.</p>
          <p>At the same time, LSTM can also be used for composing music. For example, when you listen to music, if you hear a good piece of music, you can use the LSTM network to find the entire piece, and you can also use it to create more tracks. LSTM can also be used for subtitling movies, predicting what people want to say, predicting the stock market, maintaining machines (signaling before machines are scrapped, letting people replace them with new ones) and so on.</p>
          <p>These examples are very effective and cost effective. It can be seen that LSTM has a wide range of applications. However, this is not the general purpose of AI. At present, AI can only recognize speech, language and so on. However, unlike the process of infant learning, AI does not interact with the world around it, establish three views, and learn how to interact with the world to achieve its goals. It is the purpose of general AI to learn for the purpose and do not require teachers' guidance. But I'm very happy to see that so many people around the world are using LSTM, but it's only a small part of real artificial intelligence. What we are more interested in is how to implement AGI and achieve real AI.</p>
          <p>LSTM is the best way to solve the AI problem at present. Maybe we will find a better way in the future. After all, technology always has room for improvement. In the future, artificial intelligence is expected to automatically search for buildings. In 2009, one of my Ph.D. students mentioned in his paper that it is possible that artificial intelligence could evolve automatically in the future. And according to different applications, different improvements can be found in the future.</p>
          <p>Reporter: do you know some Chinese companies that are using LSTM now? Which Chinese technology companies do you prefer?</p>
          <p>Jurgen: Although I don't know much about the smart world in China, I think, just as large companies like Google are using LSTM, there are certainly a lot of Companies in Asia and China that will use LSTM, and the scope of its application must be very wide. But perhaps Chinese companies may not be able to use LSTM at present. I know some very famous Chinese companies will also make some very good products, and I look forward to and respect them, but maybe they haven't been announced yet. For example, Baidu Inc, which I know, is also using LSTM to classify and study AI. Baidu's Silicon Valley Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence also opens up its core AI system Warp-CTC, which is based on LSTM and is a parallel implementation of fast CTC on CPU and GPU. This action is of great significance to the promotion of machine learning, artificial intelligence technology research and development.</p>
          <p>I think China is making great progress in the field of artificial intelligence. It is very open-minded and more advanced than many countries in the world. China's business policy is also correct. It protects Chinese companies from foreign interference and can conduct independent research. Unlike many European countries today, although they are completely liberalized, they tend to be controlled by foreign companies. Although China can't use foreign websites such as Facebook and Google for national security, China can do research on its own and some very famous products such as Weixin and Taobao have emerged. I think China's implementation of this policy is very good, and it can prevent plagiarism between competing countries.</p>
          <p>There are many excellent engineers and scientists in China, and it is hard to say who is better. But I believe there will be great companies or great scientists and engineers in China who will develop smart products as good as Google Translator and Amazon Alex. Of course, this requires scientists and engineers behind to do a lot of research and training on data. China has a large number of excellent talents. They will definitely create excellent intelligent products in the future.</p>
          <h3>AI can produce hundreds of billions of commercial value, and all walks of life will be affected by it.</h3>
          <p>Reporter: what are your expectations for the development of AI in the next 5-10 years?</p>
          <p>Jurgen: the development of AI in the next 10 years can be predicted. You will see many applications of AI in different fields. In 2005, my research team made a breakthrough in the medical field of artificial intelligence, and now many companies have artificial intelligence in the medical field of research, because behind this hidden huge market, can produce hundreds of billions of commercial value. At the same time, research in the medical field will affect millions of people and help them live longer and healthier lives. I'm very happy about this because our research can benefit humans and make them live longer and healthier. This is only one aspect of artificial intelligence development in the future. In the next 5-10 years, AI will have a more sophisticated system, a better control, and hopefully a better understanding of human thinking, a better understanding of human thinking, a better understanding of human thinking, better advice and help for humans, and a better dialogue with humans. The development of artificial intelligence in the next 10 years can be predicted by human beings at present, and is developing in a better direction.</p>
          <p>In the long run, in the future, the development of AI will not be confined to the current field. They will also make new breakthroughs in many important areas. That's unpredictable, but it must be very magical, perhaps as magical as the birth of human life, and perhaps there will be a new form of life. In the future, artificial intelligence is expected to help humans explore places and areas beyond human reach, such as outer space and so on. The past century is a century of human development, but in the future, perhaps the era of artificial intelligence, may help people in the future to understand and study the galaxy. But for specific details, people can not predict it now.</p>
          <p>Reporter: what field of AI do you think is most influential?</p>
          <p>Jurgen: There's really nothing that's going to make the most of it. Artificial intelligence is going to be a big development in every field. For example, the application in the media industry. Advertising in traditional paper media is on the decline, but advertising in social media and other online media is booming. This seems very magical, actually behind it is the use of artificial intelligence results. Through artificial intelligence data analysis, you can guess the advertisements and articles you want to see. By collecting browsing data while you're on the Internet, AI can predict what you want to see next, when, where, how long, and when you're going to click on the next page. Speculate on your preferences in psychology, and then push you to different articles and advertisements. But it is not just a process of data collection. Nowadays, the advertising industry is making use of artificial intelligence for better development. But this is just an industry affected by AI.</p>
