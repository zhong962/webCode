				<h3>"The age of intelligence"</h3>
				<p>Big data is a buzzword in today's information society.In the narrow sense of data, in computer science, data refers to the general term of all symbol media that can be input into the computer and processed by the computer program, which is the general term of meaningful Numbers, letters, symbols and analog quantity used for input electronic computer processing.Data in a broad sense, as defined by wikipedia, is information or knowledge expressed or encoded in a manner suitable for better use or processing. It can be measured, collected, reported and analyzed, and can be displayed using graphics or images.</p>

				<h3>"Ultimate intelligence"</h3>
				<p>Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in our society, and the discussion around it is becoming increasingly polarized, with many arguing that machines can either solve all human problems or drag us into the dark, dystopian abyss.</p>
				<p>In this book, the author differs from well-known figures like Bill Gates and elon musk in that the author believes that artificial intelligence is not a threat to humans, but another step in our pursuit of knowledge.</p>
				<p>He leads readers to questions like: why are we valuable?What can we create?How to survive in a world full of sentient machines?The idea that humans will create intelligent creations is scary in itself, but what if, as humans, our hidden role is that of the creator?</p>

				<h3>"The ultimate fate of mankind"</h3>
				<p>In this book, the author explores artificial intelligence from three different directions: literature, philosophy and computer science.He opened up a time warp in history, taking us back to the paleolithic period to explore the evolution of the minds of our ancestors.It then turned to philosophy of the mind and neuroscience, following in the footsteps of Plato, Aristotle and others to study their understanding of the mind.Then by reviewing the history of computer technology, we can look forward to the limitless possibilities of computer development in the future.The book cites a large number of cultural and artistic works, from ancient myths to literary classics to today's sci-fi blockbusters, to help us understand how the stories in culture and art from ancient times originated, and how they are related to our current cognitive system and artificial intelligence.</p>
