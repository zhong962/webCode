          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s31.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, if everyone chooses to start a business today, I suggest that you should pay more attention to artificial intelligence, not the Internet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why do you say this?</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Internet traffic dividends have disappeared</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of PCs, global PC shipments have fallen for five consecutive years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you know who is the last PC Internet unicorn in the country? It is known that it was launched in early 2011. Over the years, there has been no unicorn on the PC Internet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To make an analogy, we know that the penetration and competition level of mobile Internet in 2015 is similar to that of PC Internet in 2011. By analogy, it is difficult to get a unicorn after doing mobile APP in 2015.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, China's mobile phone shipments have been more than 500 million units for two consecutive years, and the growth has slowed down. On the other hand, wireless traffic has basically gone flat. If you sell one more, I will sell one less, which is stock competition. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today, entrepreneurs are making a pure Internet app. The first question investors ask is how you get customers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because the traffic pattern has been fixed at this stage, the first screen is the few APPs.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s32.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Internet + opportunities are equally limited</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main value of the Internet lies in solving information asymmetry and connectivity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So it is especially valuable for e-commerce. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Taobao solved the information asymmetry with the credit system such as crown and diamond, and at the same time connected so many buyers and sellers across the country. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the value of the Internet.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But many industry information and connections are not pain points. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Take medical examples, there are so many doctors in the top three hospitals in China. It is useless to connect the 1.3 billion people in the country with these doctors, because a doctor can only see so many patients a day. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Internet has not improved the efficiency of doctor visits. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In traditional areas such as catering and medical care, the Internet's help is very limited.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It also includes drip taxis. The Internet solves the problem of difficult taxis, but it does not solve the problem of taxi prices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, after the subsidy was removed, everyone found that the drops were not cheap at all. The reason is very simple—whether it is a car or a taxi, or it needs to be opened by people. If the labor cost cannot be reduced, it will not be cheap.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. It is artificial intelligence that can really improve social productivity and solve the imbalance between supply and demand.</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The increase that artificial intelligence will bring to social productivity and its impact on humans will far exceed the Internet.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Still taking medical care, many primary hospitals are not high-level, and in the future, artificial intelligence can be used to assist doctors in reading medical images such as CT and X-ray. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like this year, IBM Watson's diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma has increased to 97%, far exceeding the average of 75%-84% for human experts.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the future, there will be no doubt that artificial intelligence will have huge social benefits in the fields of unmanned vehicles, robotics, medical care, finance, education or other fields. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I suggest that current entrepreneurs should pay more attention to entrepreneurial opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. Artificial Intelligence vs Artificial Intelligence +</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artificial intelligence is mainly divided into three layers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the bottom is the infrastructure, which includes clouds, chips, and frameworks like TensorFlow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Above the base layer is the middle layer, called Enabling Technology, such as image recognition, speech recognition, semantic understanding, and machine translation.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The base layer and the middle layer are the battlegrounds for the Internet giant. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, in the chip field, Intel, NVIDIA and Qualcomm have invested heavily and the competition is extremely fierce. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same is true for cloud computing and frameworks. It is not a territory where small companies can get involved.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nowadays, BAT is also extremely important for the general technology of the middle layer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because everyone believes that artificial intelligence is the next wave of industrial revolution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the giants such as Tencent, Ali, and Baidu, if you want to stand up in the big waves, you must build an ecosystem of artificial intelligence (Ecosystem). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The core is to rely on these Enabling Technology technologies.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s33.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Compared with startups, what is the biggest advantage of BAT? First, there is no shortage of data. Second, in order to build their own ecosystem, the future universal technology must be all free; third, although the general technology is free, BAT has The chance of a pig with wool on it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a typical Internet play.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is the pig here? The pig is the cloud. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, Baidu's ABC strategy stands for artificial intelligence (AI), big data (Big Data) and cloud computing (Cloud Computing). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AI I can not make money, open to everyone, then everyone wants to enjoy my service, come buy my cloud.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For start-ups, only general-purpose technologies such as image recognition, speech recognition, semantic understanding, and machine translation are expected to sell money through the SDK, and the road will become narrower and narrower in the future, especially under the pressure of BAT.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So from this perspective, the risk of starting a two-tier startup is relatively large. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think that the opportunity of a startup is at the top, that is, holding the results of the next two layers to serve the vertical industry, which is what we call artificial intelligence.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5. Artificial Intelligence + vs + Artificial Intelligence</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The artificial intelligence + that goes deep into the vertical industry can be subdivided into two types of situations: “artificial intelligence + industry” and “industry + artificial intelligence”. There is a clear difference between them.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“AI+ Industry” is simply that before the AI ​​technology matured, this industry and products never existed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such as autonomous driving, Amazon's Echo smart speaker, Apple's Siri voice assistant. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no such product until the artificial intelligence technology has broken through. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because of AI, it has created a brand new industry chain.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Industry + AI” means that the industry itself has always existed, and the industrial chain is mature. It was only labor-based and low in efficiency. Now, after adding AI elements, the efficiency of the industry has been significantly improved. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such as security, medical and other fields.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Objectively speaking, both categories have entrepreneurial opportunities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But "AI+ industry", because it is a new industry chain, the startup company and the Internet giant are actually at the same starting line. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The giants have the advantage of data. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So from this perspective, “industry + AI” is more friendly to startups and easier to build barriers.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I believe that the future industry barriers are the biggest moat for artificial intelligence entrepreneurship. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because each industry has vertical depth, although BAT technology is better, it is not critical. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Take medical + AI for example, what is the most important? A large number of accurate data marked by doctors is the most important. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without data, the talented scientists are useless.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at home, this medical data is very difficult to come up with. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, BAT has no advantage in medical treatment, because they have to make these data from various hospitals and departments to be very tired. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conversely, if an entrepreneur has been working in the medical industry for many years, it may be easier to pick up the data than the big company.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This requires that the partners of the founding team must have talents who understand the industry and have industry resources. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the same as the Internet +. Once it is subdivided into specific industries, it does not mean that you have Baidu and Tencent have funds and traffic. If you invest in talents, you can do everything. There are also industry resources and contacts.</font></font></p>

          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s34.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reason why I talked to you about this topic is because I went to Baidu University to talk to you in the previous paragraph. They mentioned Baidu artificial intelligence in the application of unmanned vehicles and DuerOS. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, I asked me that the application of face recognition in the field of domestic security is very large. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like Hikvision, which has a market capitalization of nearly 300 billion yuan, the net profit per year is nearly 10 billion. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Baidu should consider entering the field in terms of AI. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I replied that you should never, because security is a typical "industry + AI" field with huge barriers.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if Baidu technology is good, the face recognition rate is one percentage point higher than Hikvision (not necessarily, there are hundreds of AI R&amp;D teams behind Haikang). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this does not mean that Baidu can replace Haikang. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because security is "non-mission-critical", I identified 95 of 100 inmates, and you identified 96 more than I did, which is not that important.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In turn, what advantages does Haikang have over Baidu? First, Haikang is a camera. It is natural to run his own algorithm with his own hardware. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just like an Apple phone, the software and hardware experience is better. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Secondly, Haikang has done so many years of security, accumulated a lot of data, face data, environmental data ... in the security field has data advantages. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finally, Haikang has done a lot of things for the public security system, such as the police service, base station information collection, view file management and other SaaS platforms, as well as the police cloud system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We can think of the IT system of the public security system, and some of them are involved in Hikvision.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These things may not make money, but they have created barriers for Haikang. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because the underlying infrastructure is built by me, the front-end thing can only be used by me (I can have 100 reasons, saying that competing products are not compatible with me). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, Haikang has been doing this for a long time and has accumulated a large amount of customer resources, especially the resources of the government public security bureau. It takes time to develop these resources.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s35.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These are the so-called industry depths. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So even for BAT, if you want to enter the "industry + AI" field, you should be very cautious when choosing a vertical track. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the face of huge industry barriers, I really don't mean that my algorithm is better than you. The market is mine. Only the technical advantage is still far away.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Returning to “AI+ industry” and “industry+AI”, the industry of the former is usually shallower, while the latter has huge industry barriers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Industry barriers are the biggest moat for startups and the key to resisting BAT.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">6. Critical applications vs non-critical applications</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When it comes to entrepreneurship in the field of artificial intelligence, many people have a misconception that if my team does not have a big cow scientist, such as Stanford, MIT's doctoral sitting, I am embarrassed to start a business in artificial intelligence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, this cognition is completely wrong. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because in the field of artificial intelligence, how important an algorithm is depends on which industry you are going to enter.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Depending on the industry and application scenarios, I believe that artificial intelligence entrepreneurship is essentially mission-critical and non-mission-critical. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the convenience of everyone, we are referred to as “critical applications” and “non-critical applications”.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Critical applications" must pursue a number of 9 after 99.9%. If you can't do it, you can't commercialize it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, do you think that 99% reliable autopilot can get on the road? Certainly not, it means 1 accident at 100 times. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">99.9% did not work, and 1000 accidents occurred.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remember, the 99% and 99.9% reliability gap is not 0.9%, but the reverse is 10 times. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It also includes surgical robots, which sounds 99.9% reliable, but means 1,000 medical accidents, placed in the United States, hospitals can not be bankrupted by huge claims.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, the field of "critical applications" is the field of artificial intelligence that can't be made with a little mistake. It must be a technical bull, scientist or algorithm expert. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, the development cycle of such projects is very long.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s36.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just like Israel's Mobileye, which is the ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) solution, it was acquired by Intel for $15.3 billion in March. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you know how long the company's R&amp;D cycle is? Mobileye was founded in 1999, and it was 2007 when they launched their first product and earned the first gold. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Up to 8 years of research and development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is unimaginable in Internet entrepreneurship. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Including Google's unmanned vehicles began research and development in 2009, and has not been commercialized until now; the Da Vinci surgical robot took 10 years from the start of research and development to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certification in 2000.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The common feature of “critical applications” is that the projects are usually expensive, the development cycle is huge, the money is very far away, and the need for continuous financing, how can the team continue to finance? At least have a very good resume and very good background. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a necessary prerequisite for continued financing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So everyone can see that today's unmanned entrepreneurial team is Gao Fushuai. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because it is not a rich and handsome, you can't find the day when the product is actually commercialized.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, if you are a "critical application" in the field of artificial intelligence, then most entrepreneurs have nothing to do. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, 95% of startups in the field of artificial intelligence are “none-mission-critical”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Simply speaking, for these areas, the reliability of AI is only a little over the baseline, and the difference is a little higher.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the simplest case, many companies now use face recognition for access control. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You bring a hat today, wearing a sunglasses or a mask tomorrow, the recognition rate can't be 99%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But no problem even if it is not recognized. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because all access control with face recognition has a place for you to press the fingerprint. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if the fingerprints are not brushed in, the problem is not big, the company does not have a front desk.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the "non-critical application." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This type of project does not pursue 99% followed by a large number of 9. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, most of the areas of domestic artificial intelligence and robotic entrepreneurship are “non-critical applications”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, it is not that the algorithm is not important in this field. You can't recognize it every day, so you must pass the basic availability threshold. Occasionally, problems can be tolerated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Key applications” cannot be tolerated.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, when you are in the startup team, you must think about which field the track you choose is in. The different track requirements for the team are different. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Critical applications” must be technically sturdy, and “non-critical applications” require teams to be more comprehensive and comprehensive.</font></font></p>
