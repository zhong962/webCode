          <h1 class="title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yang Qiang: Where is the next technical enthusiasm and commercial vents of artificial intelligence?</font></font></h1>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As the chief scientist of the fourth paradigm and the tutor of the Paradigm University, Professor Yang Qiang recently conducted a training on the theme of “The Next Three Years of Artificial Intelligence” within the Fourth Paradigm Company, sharing his own ideas in the artificial intelligence industry. The experience and pre-judgment of the technical turmoil and commercial turmoil of artificial intelligence is about to break out. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Previously, Professor Yang Qiang and the fourth paradigm had proposed five essential conditions for artificial intelligence, providing an authoritative access standard for the artificial intelligence industry.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">

          <div class="two">
            <h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. What did AlphaGo bring to us?</font></font></h2>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone remembers that in March 2016, AlphaGo came out to play against Li Shizhen, which has a great social impact on artificial intelligence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here, let us ask: What did AlphaGo bring to us?</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In AlphaGo's search, the Deepmind team introduced a new concept—that is, the combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning to distinguish between two tasks, namely, to determine whether the board is good or bad, and to predict the future. Going. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Speaking of this, you should be able to see the correlation between AlphaGo's algorithm and the future business model. That is, through the analysis of big data, let us have a reliable understanding of the "current state"; this state can be a chessboard, but it can be The state of the two teams in football can also be a state of current marketing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, one step in the game of Go can be understood as a prejudgment of the future direction. In business activities, this can be the next step in marketing activities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An important point here is to distinguish between two tasks in our business behavior, namely, the judgment of reality and the prediction of the future direction of business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These two tasks are equally important, and they all require the support of big data. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because Go is a closed game (that is, there is no interference from outside factors), in order to get more data, AlphaGo also introduced a self-game. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The so-called self-game is to play the game by yourself, you will get constant feedback, and then update your strategy. After countless such games, you will get a good strategy and your final output is a behavioral strategy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So AlphaGo also tells us that in a closed scene, you can use the simulation method of self-game to get more data.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Application flow from AlphaGo to artificial intelligence</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we follow the steps of Go, we have to face these questions: What is the goal of your artificial intelligence algorithm? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Is there any data? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Where is the data? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Is the boundary of the problem clear? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is a reasonable move, what is the law of the foul? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Where are your characteristics? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How do you get these features? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Can I get a continuous feedback? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such a process is the path that the AlphaGo design team has traveled. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's a good idea to write down these steps and turn them into a workflow to see if other areas can repeat the success of AlphaGo. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, if you use AlphaGo to treat cancer, how to treat it? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Treating cancer generally uses radioactivity to kill cancer cells. Each cancer patient may need different doses, angles, and frequencies. If all of this information can be recorded, record the treatment results, because the results are not immediately I know, but after a while I know that there is data, features, continuous feedback, and a very clear goal of killing cancer cells with minimal side effects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And this workflow is repeatable.</font></font></p>

            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are still 30 years of development history of AI, and the accumulation of these years is also very useful.</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We just talked about AlphaGo all the way, but our understanding of artificial intelligence should not be one-sidedly considered that artificial intelligence is machine learning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The history of artificial intelligence has been in the first 30 years, and the first 30 years have been in the mid-1950s. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are you doing in this 30-year AI? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is a regular knowledge-based study of human input, and the reasoning and searching of symbol spaces based on these rules. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I believe that this artificially-formed knowledge representation is also essential in the application of AI, because in many fields there will be problems with cold start and how to regulate the boundaries of a field. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is to say, the branch of artificial reasoning, logical knowledge representation, and artificial intelligence in the search for symbol space will be greatly developed in the next few years in combination with statistical learning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This development will also involve both technical and commercial aspects.</font></font></p>
            <h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Second, where is the technical vent of AI?</font></font></h2>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the issues that we all care about is that there may be major breakthroughs in the direction of artificial intelligence technology.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deep learning</font></font></h3>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s113.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, deep learning will continue to develop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The development here is not only an increase in the level, but also the interpretability of deep learning and the self-causal expression of the conclusions obtained from deep learning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, how to use unstructured data as raw data, train a statistical model, and then turn this model into a kind of knowledge expression - this is a kind of representation learning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This technique is very helpful for unstructured data, especially for knowledge learning in natural language. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, the structural design of the deep learning model is a difficult point of deep learning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These structures are very much in need of human design today. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another research question is how to make logical reasoning and deep learning work together, which can also increase the interpretability of deep learning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, building a Bayesian model requires a lot of designer experience, and until now, it was basically set by people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we can derive a Bayesian model from the deep learning process, then learning, interpretation, and reasoning can be unified.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Migration learning</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Migration learning is also the work that I and Dai Wenyuan (the founder and CEO of the fourth paradigm) have been doing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Given a deep learning network, such as an encoder network and a decoder network, we can look at the process of learning and migration, as a new data to train another interpretable model, or as a new migration learning algorithm. Output. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, one student A is observing another student B. The purpose of A is to learn B's learning method. B is constantly learning new fields. Each time he changes a field, he provides a new data sample for A. A uses these new ones. Samples can learn to migrate between domains. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So this process is called observing the network. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With this algorithm of learning and learning methods, you can learn the migration method in the process of machine learning.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Natural language representation learning and machine reading</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It means that learning can be learned when the data and tasks are not directly related. An important example is self-taught learning, that is, we can learn the best expression through many supervise data and images. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With this expression plus the task, you can quickly learn this knowledge representation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unstructured data is quite useful at this time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, given a paragraph to let the machine read, machine learning can automatically find some points worthy of attention. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, given that an entity in an article has such a relationship with an unknown variable, the user can then ask you what the unknown variable is. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This effect can be achieved because the depth model already has a concern that can be expressed by the viewer's Attention. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The result is as if we read a book at a glance, we will capture the keywords and their relationship. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is actually an intuitive use of similar people to learn.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Human-machine dialogue system</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It should be said that one area has developed to the critical point, which is the field of human-machine dialogue systems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now in this area, some relatively vertical aspects have already collected enough data, one is customer service, one is a car (personal car conversation inside the car); there is a specific task for a specific scene, like Amazon Echo, you You can talk to it, you can say "You give me a song" or "You broadcast the news", Amazon Echo is a circle of 8 microphones, this array can detect whether people are talking to it, such as When I talk to others, my face turns and it will not respond. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This wake-up function is very accurate. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another feature is that when your hands can't control the phone, you can use voice control. The case scene is the living room and kitchen. Amazon Echo is especially popular with housewives in the US, so like this particular scene, If you collect enough data, you can train such a powerful dialogue system.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Enhanced migration learning</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We can imagine that the combination of deep learning, reinforcement learning and migration learning in the future can achieve the following breakthroughs: feedback can be delayed, personalized, and a generic model can be applied to any individual. Such a composite model can be called enhanced migration. Learning model.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reliability model of artificial intelligence</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AI as Reliable Services is a theme given by AAAI's former president, Thomas Dietterich, at AAAI 2016. Artificial intelligence can only be used as an example to prove what can be done, such as playing chess and driving, but in many cases it is still unreliable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's not like a commercial software today, it allows you to use it with confidence, so that its error rate will certainly not exceed a small percentage. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the contrary, AI may be very wrong when making mistakes, so it is not appropriate to use an average to represent an accuracy rate. Instead, it should consider its confidence interval more. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In other words, the white user takes some artificial intelligence modules to build a system, the system should be able to be put out, and its effect should be within a fixed range, so artificial intelligence should be made like software engineering.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The fourth paradigm core product "Prophet Platform" has been developing in this direction. The Prophet has engineered the artificial intelligence module and guaranteed the reliability to a certain extent, so that ordinary users can use it to build their own artificial intelligence system.</font></font></p>
            <h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Third, the AI ​​society after many years</font></font></h2>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finally, let me talk about what I think of the AI ​​society after many years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think that in the future, there should be a few people running a company. Everyone can lead thousands of robots. These robots are doing different things, and they are trained to be good at it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are now in a traditional industry, where 20% of people are doing 80% of the work, then 20% of them are the people who run the company in the future, and the remaining 80% of the work will be left to the machine. carry out. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The automation and intelligence of a company also represents the company's commercial response speed and competitiveness.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The changes that artificial intelligence brings to humans are very far-reaching. Artificial intelligence is not just a game, an application, but the whole society is truly changing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Machines and people will become a common "army" to constantly overcome the fortress and promote the human process to develop in a better direction.</font></font></p>
