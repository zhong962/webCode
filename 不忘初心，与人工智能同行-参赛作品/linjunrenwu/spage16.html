          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The China Zhigu Conference was held in Nanjing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhang Yu, an honorary director of the Academic Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems of Tsinghua University, attended the meeting and gave a keynote speech on the industrialization of artificial intelligence.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Academician Zhang Wei pointed out that the important reason why artificial intelligence is hot now is the high industrial demand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The demand for intelligence in the manufacturing and service industries will become an important driving force for the development of artificial intelligence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhang Wei said that artificial intelligence actually allows the computer to realize the three functions of people: thinking, perception and action effects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The smart manufacturing industry needs to quickly meet the needs of the market, and the market demand is constantly changing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, artificial intelligence to make decision-making under the information is very suitable and contribute to the development of the industry.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhang Wei also revealed that the general direction that is being done now is to solve the problems within a certain range through big data analysis, so that the industry can develop better. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is understood that this data platform has collected some research results and materials from various places. At present, many predictions about infectious disease prediction and used car sales have been made. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, Zhang Wei also said that there are big data analysis companies all over the world, but many still lack deep and intelligent analysis.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The following is the full text of the speech:</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The question of artificial intelligence is so hot or industrialized now, everyone's enthusiasm is so high, I think an important reason is first of all demand, whether this demand is in the primary industry, the secondary industry or the tertiary industry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nowadays, because of the more people talk about, the manufacturing industry, the secondary industry or the tertiary industry, and the service industry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the demand for agriculture in agriculture is also very high. When our country was doing artificial intelligence in the 1980s, an important application in the middle was in the agricultural field. At that time, some experts in the agricultural field were made, for example, how to apply fertilizer on the back. I have talked a lot about the two issues, I will not talk about it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The demand for intelligence in the manufacturing industry and the demand for intelligence in the service industry, so I think this is an important driving force. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because of this demand, artificial intelligence will be promoted to further development.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What I am talking about today is not about demand, but about artificial intelligence technology, what kind of technology can provide what kind of industrialization needs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This process starts from the computer, the computer is very simple, everyone is using it, in fact, the computer is worthy of being used as a calculation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As we all know, traditional computer applications are mainly three aspects, technology computing and traditional data processing, and automation. In fact, all of these applications are the ability of a computer to use digital computing capabilities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we use this computer in these fields to build a mathematical model for calculation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then, artificial intelligence, everyone thinks that everyone thinks it is not smart, and everyone thinks that people are good at programs and computers are counted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So what is artificial intelligence? In fact, artificial intelligence lets the computer do the following three things. These three things are all people have. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first thing is thinking and making decisions. This is the high-level thinking of people. We sometimes talk about logical thinking or rational thinking, because when we do anything, we make decisions, do other things, and do planning. Ok, we have to do some rational thinking. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the first thing the computer has to do is whether the computer can imitate people for rational thinking. This is the first task.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second task is to perceive and perceive the surrounding environment. This is the visual, auditory, and tactile we usually talk about. Through these sensory organs to perceive the surrounding environment, we hope that computers can do this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The third thing is the impact on the surrounding environment through the hands, feet, and other institutions on the surrounding environment, then this is the third thing, this is the third thing that we often make everyone call him a robot.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Based on these things, I will tell you about what kind of technology a computer can provide, especially for the technology we use in industrialization. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, it should be said that these three content logical thinking is a perception, and a motion coordination control is the three functions that artificial intelligence that I just talked about. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, the logical thinking and logical thinking we actually talk about include the following, reasoning, decision making, diagnosis, planning, design, etc. We all think that this is the main content of a person's rational thinking. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, this now actually treats all of these thoughts as a kind of reasoning. There are several kinds of reasoning: one is that there is a reason to push the result, and from medical perspective, what symptoms will he have through the disease, then you can It is the reason to push the past backwards, and to push him from the results. The same is true for our medical treatment. Reverse reasoning, what kind of symptoms to look at, and what is the reason for thinking about him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then this is a process of thinking in all our daily decision-making and design. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the computer can do something like this, then the computer can think. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, this is one thing that traditional artificial intelligence does. It is based on human knowledge and experience to build a reasoning model and put it in the computer. The computer can think according to such a reasoning model. Sometimes heuristic search models, knowledge-driven models, rule methods, and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone knows that there are two kinds of successes, everyone is very familiar. This is a sign that artificial intelligence will do better than people in these two things. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although the first thing is about the next international game, although the national flag is a decision-making process, it is nothing more than a decision of two people. Then he wants to be the most favorable step for himself and the most unfavorable step for the other. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the end, who wins and who loses, who decides who wins correctly, or who decides who is consistent and who wins, so this is a very typical decision problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then if you can defeat the international champion under the chess, it is the decision-making problem in the case of our full information. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The computer can do more than people or just as good as people. Here, the head must add an attribute. "Complete information" means that if the computer encounters an uncertain environment and encounters a sudden change event, his processing power will be Not as good as people, but if you are in the case of a complete machine, our computer can do better than people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So the decision-making problem of complete information, we usually have a lot of things, and designing and making diagnosis are basically complete information. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This problem actually has many uses. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is done in the computer.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The very important issue we are talking about in smart manufacturing is that we are talking about personalized manufacturing now, we must be able to quickly meet the needs of the market, we will better produce the things that meet the changing needs of the market. A very important decision-making problem, this decision-making problem is a decision-making problem under complete information, so using a computer is the right question. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Including considering marketing and considering other strategies are some of the skills that need to be done. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, there is one of the following in smart manufacturing, about the intelligence and automation of production, which we talked about in the third part. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So the previous part of the ERP system we are using is not intelligent. It is often hoped that some intelligent decisions will be made on this system, and intelligent planning will improve production.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second one is the knowledge-based question-and-answer system. We can see here that this is the watson system that IBM has done. It actually shows that within a certain range, this range can be relatively large. In a certain range of questions and answers system, the computer can More than people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This everyone knows that this watson system is a game. Everyone knows that American smart games are three people playing at the same time. There are certain scopes for the topic, history, geography, entertainment, culture, and answer. Finally, the watson system is on both sides. It is the champion of the world. In the middle of the intelligent competition, artificial intelligence has defeated the world champion. That is to say, under certain circumstances and certain scenes, the human-machine question-and-answer system can reach the level of human beings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So this gives us a great inspiration on human-computer interaction. If it is below a certain limit, then the computer's question-and-answer system can work beyond people. This interaction with the network is very important because we all I know that there are probably several kinds of interactions with the Internet. The first one is search. Searching for a lot of people is keyword search. This is the easiest and easiest way to interact. This method is not very good. After you enter the keyword, there will be a lot of things suddenly. These things have something to do with you. Some things have nothing to do with you. This is the easiest way to interact. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are also some interactions that are being done now, a chat, and chat is a bit harder than keyword search. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it is easier and easier to talk than human-computer interaction. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So now some people make chats. The goal in the future is to have a dialogue with the human-machine. Then the dialogue is a bit more difficult than the question and answer. Because the dialogue has context, the question and answer will be answered. So now there is a question and answer. The question and answer is the foundation and the future. Then develop into dialogue. In fact, in the future, human-computer interaction will definitely go to the form of dialogue. Now this is also a big scene. Many companies are considering doing this. Our lab is doing this afternoon with our lab. To communicate, we should say that in the question-and-answer system, the level of the interactive system is very high, not specifically, because the focus of this project, Professor Zhu will introduce this situation to you.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second one is the knowledge-based question-and-answer system.

            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I will introduce it later, and it is also the work of our department. This is also the current general direction. How to use big data to solve a certain range of problems through the analysis of big data to develop this industry. This is a professor of our department. Work, there is a certain representative, that is, we have a lot of articles online, there are many authors, these quantities are distributed in various places, the amount of this data is very large. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the use of big data to put all the people in this field and technology field to organize, analyze and build this platform. This platform involves the information of 136 million researchers. This platform is very useful, many The employer went to find out which suitable experts, reviews, recommendations, etc., so there are still many uses, and engaged in data mining and service platforms to help you find the right technology talents. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We will also introduce in the afternoon, our laboratory has done this work, in fact, using big data to make predictions, here are a lot of infectious disease predictions, predictions of used car sales, and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why is there a lot of work in this area? The main reason is that when we used to be an expert system, we needed expert support and experience. This is scarce and expensive. Now with the public data, we can get it all at hand and many of them are not spent. Money.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So how to use big data to solve large-scale problems, this is an important aspect of our current enterprise development, this is big data analysis. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are many big data analysis companies in the world, including ours, but most of them are small in scale and have little impact. The main reason is the most important reason. We lack deep and intelligent analysis of big data analysis. . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, there are a lot of big data analysis companies, the scale is not very big, for example, which department is proposed to develop this product, you help me to look at the analysis and analysis of the prospects of this product, then these companies basically say online collection A material, after sorting out the past sales of this product, and then make a prediction based on this, hit a report, cheap tens of thousands of dollars, expensive hundreds of thousands of dollars. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why is it not good? Actually, there is a company now. A company made by Indians has developed 3,269 employees, and now it raises about 238 million US dollars. Why is it done so well? Actually, it is employed by more than 3,000 employees. Some of them are Indians, and they all have Ph.D., and they have mathematics and computer skills. Among the top 500 companies in the United States, 140 are his long-term users. Why do you find him, for example, a company? When the sales volume is reduced, he finds out the reason after the analysis, and proposes to improve the suggestion. According to his improvement suggestion, the sales volume will rise immediately. The retail store asks him to use big data to help him set up branches and where to set up. The size of each place is set. He gave him the plan. According to this plan, the sales volume is high, so we think this is a big aspect, because there are many big data, but everyone needs to know the data. But most of our data is useless to you. You find something useful in the middle of big data. This is people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Important area of ​​intelligent data mining. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, it is not easy. Your data is big, it seems to be good for you, but it poses a big challenge to you. Because you need to find out from such a large amount of data, you need a little method, so this company It is in accordance with this, and now it is very famous, so if we want to develop this kind of enterprise, we have to work on it.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this aspect of rational thinking, we do a lot of intelligent systems to serve our industry. The following aspects of perception are the perceptual behaviors we usually talk about, that is, the machine learning from the big family, the neural network refers to this, for perception, our face recognition We recognize the face but we don't know clearly. I know Zhang San, Zhang Sanchang, what do you want to describe? You can't describe it. The current method is so-called machine learning. The reason why you don't know the problem is that we pass the machine. The way to learn, that is to say, I use a lot of data to let him learn. After he finishes learning, he will. This is the deep learning we are talking about now. Why is the artificial intelligence of deep learning now very hot? A very important reason is to find The method of deep learning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then it can help us solve problems that we know but don't know why, and that you perceive a large number of problems belong to this.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cognitive, we have a lot of things that we can't say clearly. For example, if we play chess, we can basically say why I am doing this, but Go is not very good. Most of the Go masters don’t know why I want to do this. So, in the past, we have been doing the old method. As a result, he added the old method to deep learning. That is to say, those who said that they couldn’t figure out the way, I let him learn, and let the chess that all the masters had in the past. He learns, he learns to reach the masters, and then hundreds of thousands of times, this level is higher than the level of the master, so deep learning solves such a problem, and those problems we can't tell can be done with this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This result, called deep learning, is learned using a multi-layer neural network. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is actually a matter of dealing with the identification information of the image. Most of this is done by this method. This includes object detection, which is an object, including object classification, detection and classification, and object recognition. Not only do we have to find out where this object is, but we also need to know what object it is, how it is produced, and how it tracks the object. We have done a good job in these areas. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In a given database, he can reach or exceed the human level, so this is the height that the current technology can reach. Under the given conditions, this is also a large piece, biometrics, which is also the enterprise now. What we are doing, we also have a lot of work in this area, including face, face fingerprint, palm print, retina, DNA, signature, posture, keyboard stroke behavior can be identified, we are doing better Voiceprint, recognizing people with sound.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So for several aspects of the sound signal, the technology is doing better now, the first language recognition, whether you speak English or Chinese, or other languages, as well as accent recognition, where are you, voice recognition, and then Gender identification, emotional recognition, for example, you are kidnapped, he wants you to call, the computer can generally identify, there are many people identification and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many people use this machine for industrialization. Generally speaking, the industry is not large enough in this respect. Therefore, I hope that the entrepreneurs here are entrepreneurs. How do you use this technology? The key issue is to develop large industries. At present, the relative scale of these industries is relatively small. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The last question about behavior, including walking, cars, etc. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One is an industrial robot. What everyone should be familiar with is the key technology. The second generation of industrial robots already has it. This is safer and better than the original one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Service robots do a lot, there are many in the world, but now there are some bottlenecks. This is something that everyone should pay attention to. Generally speaking, there are three aspects. These four aspects are done more. One is family service. The more successful one is Sofia. (Sound) robots, we are also doing bed, this is entertainment, dialogue, education, probably the main aspects of these aspects, these aspects must be certain of some key technologies, the key technology here is intelligent problem.</font></font></p>
