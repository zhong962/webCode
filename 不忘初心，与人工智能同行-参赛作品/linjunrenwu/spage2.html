What is the patrol of the UAV power patrol? What kind of drone is needed in the power industry?</font></font></p>

            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Development status of domestic and foreign drones</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"I think the drone is still in the initial stage of development." Cao Fei said.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to Cao Fei, in 2009, the plan for the founding of Zhongfei Aiwei was not to manufacture drones, but to do applications. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, after many investigations, the drones on the market were general-purpose products, which were not professional enough. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today, eight years later, 2C and 2B drones appeared on the market. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example: Dajiang drones are moving from 2C to 2B, and zero-degree intelligent control 2B and 2C products are involved, while Latitude has been focusing on 2B drones. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many drone manufacturers start with flight control and then switch to drones. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, although they are all cross-border into the UAV manufacturing field, the ultimate goal and product are very different. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"If you compare the drone with the car, the civilian drones produced by many companies on the market can be compared to the car, but the UAV's drones are more like cranes and engineering vehicles. We hope to be drones. Sany Heavy Industry in the field."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He said that in the military field of drones, there is a certain gap between China and foreign countries in terms of core technologies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the civilian sector, China's drones will never be worse than foreign countries. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Especially for industrial applications, China is at the forefront of the world.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although there are many interesting and good new technologies in foreign countries, there are few combinations with traditional industries. This is because foreign traditional industries do not have such urgent need to make these innovations and innovations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China is welcoming an era of innovation, and UAVs are gradually being used in many fields such as agriculture, wind power generation, and environmental protection, at a very good stage. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Taking the application of drones in the power industry as an example, many foreign countries still stay in the research and professor stage of the university, and have been doing it in China for nearly eight years.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">UAV application in the power industry</font></font></h3>

          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the power industry, what services can drones provide? This starts with the pain point of the power industry.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Traditional manual inspection lines cannot meet the needs of grid operation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, the amount of inspection work is extremely large. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The country's 110 kilovolts or more transmission lines, 1.185 million kilometers, 80% -90% in the mountains. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The traditional patrol line needs to be patrolled once a month. The ground patrol line needs people to take a telescope to see it on the spot, but there are often no roads to go. This is a typical work scene. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Second, the manual inspection line is inefficient. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most of the time, the line of inspection requires people to climb over the mountains, resulting in long inspection time and low efficiency. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Third, the ground observation effect is poor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An iron tower is about thirty-fifty meters high. It is difficult to see clearly because it has obstacles on the ground. Sometimes it is necessary to climb the tower to check for defects, but because it is live, there is a great security risk.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The emergence of drone service line services can safely and efficiently solve the needs of the power grid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cao Fei believes that because the drone is not subject to terrain restrictions, it is more than 20 times more efficient than traditional manual inspection. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhongfei Ivy can provide two models to meet the different needs of the power grid.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One is the fixed wing, which is mainly used for channel inspection. It is the so-called look at whether there is any sand excavation under the line, illegal construction, illegal construction or ice coating, mountain fire, and the hidden dangers around the line.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s13.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The other is a multi-rotor for fine-grained inspection of the line body to eliminate construction defects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example: the details of the tower, whether the nut on the bolt is correctly installed, whether there is any sign of falling off, or it is not installed during construction.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s14.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, there are many extended applications for drones, which can be measured with infrared light, because some defective surfaces are fine, but internal damage will heat up. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Laser scanning can also be used for distance measurement to accurately measure the distance from the wire to the tree barrier.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to meet the needs of the power grid, Zhongfei Aiwei has launched a variety of drones, from fixed-wing to multi-rotor, from visible light to infrared to laser scanning, from transmission line inspection to the current substation inspection. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, in order to make the drone more suitable for power line inspection, in terms of hardware, the Zhongfei Aiwei UAV uses a honeycomb composite material that is lighter than carbon fiber, and the material has good insulation.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From automation to intelligence, making drone inspections smarter</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cao Fei said frankly that the biggest problem now is that "the drone is not unmanned", and the drone needs people to control it, which greatly reduces the quality and efficiency of the inspection work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the automation and even the intelligentization of the drone is realized, it will undoubtedly solve this problem effectively. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now, he leads the team to develop a "Dragon Nest UAV" inspection program that does not require manual intervention.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After entering the automated flight study, the team encountered a very difficult problem, that is, the drone's battery life is not long enough. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So they borrowed the working principle of the sweeping robot and installed the charging pile on the iron tower, so that the drone can continue to sail in time when the power is insufficient during the line inspection, and it is also considered that the drone has a home, so that they can operate in real time.</font></font></p>

          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s15.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"This is not our whimsy. We will cooperate with the power grid for a scientific research project, highlighting the first demonstration line of the UAV's own inspection line. This is not only in China, but also in the world. We are not the first one. A simple drone, but a space patrol robot.” Cao Fei solemnly stated that the realization of this goal requires the realization of “four modernizations”, namely: empirical dataization, acquisition standardization, identification of machine, and data assetization.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Empirical data: In the early stage, through manual data acquisition and analysis, a basic 3D digital space map was formed, so that the drone can fly autonomously.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Acquisition standardization: Through the basic space map, with high-precision autonomous positioning technology and autonomous programming shooting technology, standardized data acquisition is realized.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Identification of machine: Based on massive data of standardized UAV inspection lines, the identification of artificial intelligence defects began to be gradually realized.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Data assetization: Zhongfei Aiwei cooperated with the power grid to establish a drone management line lean management system to realize the closed-loop management of the UAV power inspection operation process and the collection, sorting, classification and screening of the inspection data. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because the drone has no information such as lines before the line is patrolled, the scattered data is of low value. Therefore, by using the cloud platform such as Microsoft Azure for storage and calculation, it is possible to automatically provide analysis reports for users. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is also the transformation of Zhongfei Aiwei to promote the grid from automation to intelligence.</font></font></p>

          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s16.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">

          <div class="two">
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhongfei Ivy: Building a plane is not our goal</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a pioneer of industrial drone operation services, with a deep power background and deep understanding of the drones and power industry, Zhongfei Aiwei has created a number of UAV power line applications and participated in the development of no one. The machine power operation instruction book and enterprise standards, its drone inspection service has covered more than 20 provinces and cities around the world, and the market coverage is the first.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Looking into the future, Cao Fei said: "In an industry, we will do specialization, and building aircraft is not our goal. We use drones as tools to collect data from traditional industries, while using artificial intelligence technology to collect The data is analyzed. Ultimately, using these data to integrate the industry with the grid and promote industrial upgrading is our goal."</font></font></p>
