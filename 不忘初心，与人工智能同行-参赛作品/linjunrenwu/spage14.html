            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since Google Alpha Go and World Go Champion Li Shishi staged "Century Man-machine Wars", the attention of artificial intelligence has been pushed to an unprecedented height. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence technology has experienced several cycles of peaks and valleys, and artificial intelligence has great appeal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are huge difficulties in the process of industrialization.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mr. Zhu Hengyuan said that we are currently in the midst of a new round of global technology mergers and industrial transformations. It is both a technological revolution and an industrial revolution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So for artificial intelligence and its related data, robotics technology is the most striking emerging industry in this wave. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Research institutions, industry, academia, and government departments all pay close attention to the latest developments in artificial intelligence.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The following is the full text of the speech:</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhu Hengyuan: I am very happy. Thanks to Jiangning District for providing us with such a good platform for those teachers who have seen me here. If it is not this meeting, we will not have a chance to meet in a garden. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The former academicians and experts have talked a lot of very professional new signs about artificial intelligence, new trends, more from a technical point of view, or more from a good side, these I do not understand, What should I do? I have to say something that I understand is a little different from the teachers. Maybe everyone here will be interested in it.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I want to discuss the direction in which artificial intelligence can break through in the future from the perspective of an industrial development. I think there are many companies and friends in the investment community who may be concerned about this aspect. This is our global industry. The field of expertise of the Institute. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As we all know, now we are in the midst of a new wave of technology mergers and industrial changes in the world. We say that he is both a technological revolution, he is also an industry revolution, then artificial intelligence and related data, robots. This technology is one of the most striking emerging industries in this wave. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Scientific research institutions, industry, academia, and government departments are all not paying close attention to the latest progress of artificial intelligence. If you look at the ordinary people like me who are eating melons, it is probably the chess that almost everyone is concerned about. This year's March is almost a year away. Google's Alpha dog defeated the top human Go player by five to one. This is the first phenomenal event in the field of artificial intelligence, because Go is better than other chess. Classes are relatively more complex, and they are much more complex. The first is only considered to be the intellectual bastion of humans that computers can't overcome in the short term. I remember that in 1997, IBM's supercomputing and dark blue beat the top human players. At that time, the most reasonable prediction at that time was that it took at least a hundred years for the computer to achieve corresponding results in the field of Go. This was in 1997, but it was not thought that human beings had made a very important breakthrough in the field of technology. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, this day, actually came too fast, because the Alpha dog has a different path, searching for limited steps, he is more like the human intelligence, has a global view, the natural high-level Alpha dog algorithm in artificial intelligence Milestone significance, this is a landmark event, that is to say, this iconic event has brought artificial intelligence into the public's field of vision and increased credibility through overwhelming media propaganda, so it is very hot. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The artificial intelligence has been pushed to a new height, and this new height is not only in the field of research, but also in industry-related investments, including media reports. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if we look back at the progress of the entire human technology, we will find that the development of emerging technologies is often full of possibilities, and the variables are actually very many. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the early days of the development of emerging technologies, when the technology was not industrialized or just started to be industrialized, his scale was small, and his slight disturbance from technology or market could cause dramatic changes in the evolutionary trajectory of emerging technologies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this time, the technology is not mature enough, there is no product that can be mass-produced, based on the observation of the product and product life cycle, and the theoretical framework and tools developed, in the early stage of the early emerging technologies, there is no use for heroes. feel. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Research on emerging technologies, I think here, please learn from the so-called technology maturity curve, if we are mature from this perspective and the areas related to artificial intelligence, where is he now.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Generally speaking, he divided the technology into the industrialization and formed a large-scale application into five stages. In the early stage, because he was the embryonic stage of the so-called technology at the earliest stage, there was no practical application, and the commercial feasibility was not confirmed. At this stage, new technologies began to be reported and paid attention by the media. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After this stage, we entered a rising channel. We called it the expected expansion period. With the constant attention of the public, we have produced a series of success stories. It is a story, a success story, and the application of technology. The outlook is constantly being imagined, and technology is being over-focused. During this period, the bright prospects have attracted more and more entrants, and the influx of funds and resources. Although there are many examples of failures, the market has not been affected by enthusiasm. People seem to selectively forget the examples of so-called failures. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This time passed, there was a downturn called the bubble burst, product and operation failed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Negative evaluations began to appear, and the public began to lose interest gradually.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, there was a large number of active companies in the market. At the same time, there were a large number of active companies on the market, which disappeared due to failure. The surviving companies began to face severe conditions to change products and re-explore the path of industrialization in order to obtain investment to survive the winter. Once you have passed this stage, here are two stages that we all hope for. One is called the "stable period of steady climb" and the peak of production. This is the general concept he talks about, and this is basically the same. What we said in front of several academicians, just after getting hotter and hotter, after overheating and then overheating, drop a little, and then continue to heat, we are worth paying attention to this year, when this year in July, Gartner released the so-called The maturity curve of emerging technologies in 2016. In this curve, if you pay close attention to it, you will find that these technologies in these areas related to artificial intelligence are there, as you can see in this field. In the field of artificial intelligence, it is basically in the expectation, the so-called expected expansion period. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is to say, it is very hot and hot to overheat, so everyone has a high expansion of his expectations. Under such a condition, as we have seen, many IT giants have announced their entry into the field of artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence entrepreneurship. The emergence of enterprises, such as springing up, has been enthusiastically sought after by capital. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, today is the eighth conference I have recently received about discussing the development of artificial intelligence, so you can imagine how hot he is. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not only that, we all know that in such a development process, artificial intelligence is hot, and the government is hot. Just now experts mentioned that governments have begun to introduce various policy support, such as even the US government. It also published two reports in a row, called the strategic planning of national intelligence research and development, preparing for human artificial intelligence. Local governments at all levels and industrial parks at all levels are very hot.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a scholar of industrial research, we are here to see the lively scene of artificial intelligence. We think that there may be a cooling process behind many overheated things. Don’t forget, This technology maturity curve expects the expansion period to be an expectation to burst. Not every climb into the trough reaches a stable peak. Some technologies have no way to climb the Death Valley. Some technologies have to go through several rounds of peaks and valleys. The cycle, presenting their so-called constant rational techniques, we recall that the foundation of artificial intelligence is actually the 1950s of the last century. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So in this case, when we are at a peak in the market, when we are thriving, we hope that the next stage of the market is forbidden by all people, because every time the winter arrives, there will be a large number of enterprises that cannot get out. This trough disappeared. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although these enterprises have disappeared, their own ability in technology industrialization has not been in vain. It is particularly interesting that the advancement of these technologies, the design of products, and the exploration of business models will be precipitated in the industry. The bottom of the industry is talents, patents, and And the product method, and then transfer the results, until the next expectation of high, these broken accumulation will be recalled by later companies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Every entrepreneurial enterprise is in the process of spewing, is it a little more consideration, consider a longer one, is it in the next so-called low valley, or in the process of this trough, I will not die, that thing as long as After passing through the Death Valley, I am the winner of all the winners. If not, I will be absorbed by other plants when I wait in the spring. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So we have to consider, if the company that has invested now, or the company already in this field, if we think that the next one is really Death Valley, how can we cross the Death Valley? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, although this curve characterizes the trajectory of the development of emerging technologies, there are still many disputes about this trajectory. We also have some research, but we have not provided useful tips and help on how to get out of the disillusioned Death Valley. How do we? Do it? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We will talk about it in a lot of time, the past is not forgotten, the teacher of the future, and the new knowledge, we look at the history of the successful industrialization of the emerging technology in history, perhaps how artificial intelligence can prepare for the winter How to get out of Death Valley to achieve industrial breakthroughs and provide some inspiration and reference.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I give three simple examples, which are very familiar to everyone. The first one is (English). This is a very famous laboratory in the center of Silicon Valley. Apple Lisa is a user interface, one is a mouse, but unfortunately this Technology has been behind for a long time, until Apple uses it in its own system, and then the Queen, another wave of helpers is Microsoft, Microsoft put the entire graphical user system, after the introduction of windows makes this market very fast, this is the first One, another, Microsoft itself is relying on another giant called IBM's own operating system, if there is no IBM, then he can not go to such a fast application. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I only said the conclusion, everyone thinks about the history of the browser. Now everyone hates the IE browser, but in the early days it was defeated (English). He was free to individual users at the earliest. How did he survive? He actually does this by giving individual users but charging business users. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we are faced with a difficult choice in the process of industrialization of an emerging technology. We can either go to the 2B market or the 2C market. The most recent example is that the University’s largest intelligent voice is currently the largest intelligent voice in China. The technology company is the only listed company in this field. At the beginning of the business, it was created (English), the product is good, but it never opened the market. Later, it was inspired by Intel and developed IF inside, so Xunfei Establishing a partnership with Huawei to establish a voice service system to commercialize the intelligent voice of Xunfei.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The above examples give us some inspiration. Emerging technologies in the early days, the choice of 2B and 2C markets is a very important key choice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are many examples in history that have passed the winter of technology for the 2B market. Why, in fact, the reason is very simple. First, in the early stage, for the emerging technology, the society needs a certain amount. The recipient of this concept of a certain concentration, the emergence of Apple's new user interface and the user's graphical interface is a great expansion of the concentration of user recipients in this process, a certain number, a certain concentration of the concept of the recipient can Maintaining a minimum market size and growing continuously, a certain amount can maintain the size of the market, and certain farmers can maintain the emerging technology in the early stage to enable diffusion.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A certain amount that cannot be reached, a certain concentration can reach a certain market in theory. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Emerging companies can maintain sufficient resources to pass through Death Valley. Even if there is a certain amount, a certain concentration of recipients may not be able to form an effective market. In the early stage of emerging technology development, it is difficult to establish a professional system based on a single startup. If Microsoft is not with the IBM system, when the personal computer is not popular, it is impossible to push the system to thousands of households. The enterprise has a complete enterprise. The emerging technology breaks through an existing business. Combine and solve this business problem, or improve efficiency, or reduce costs, or create greater value for the end customer, from the outside of the enterprise, the existing business facilities in the market can be combined with emerging technologies. This will make the company's postal competitive advantage more favorable and expand the scale of market competition. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's take a look at these. Let's take a look at Huawei's Mr. Ren Zhengfei's recent work on how artificial intelligence technology is combined with Huawei's existing business. This experience is actually a road to market, how artificial intelligence blooms, this round of technology. The wave of change has already prepared a sufficient number and sufficient concentration of concept recipients for artificial intelligence. The technology companies that are the first to achieve industrial breakthroughs in the future will have a large probability of being enterprise-level from a market that matches themselves. Application start-up, artificial intelligence dual gateway technology, on the one hand is widely used, involving intelligent voice, intelligent image recognition, big data, unmanned driving, etc. On the other hand, from basic data analysis to meet our specific needs of professional Skills, to versatile intelligent robots to complex robots that are more likely to be possible in the future, the span is enormous. Obviously, in sci-fi works, high-intelligent robots are unlikely to appear in the short term, but in the near future, they can solve specific problems in life and production. Problem, artificial intelligence products with specific functions and human-machine collaboration will </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As the mushrooming, the key question is how to cross the Death Valley, how to find key enterprise applications, parasitic on existing technologies according to new technologies, easier to achieve product development, and for the development of artificial intelligence, which area is the first to take the lead Blooming, the fusion of artificial intelligence breakthrough technology product forms, these are the entrepreneurs who need us here, all the technology, experts, investment experts, in the practice to answer and create, I hope that in the future we can all from here It is possible to produce products that have a major impact on the well-being of the entire society and the entire consumer, and which day we look forward to.</font></font></p>
