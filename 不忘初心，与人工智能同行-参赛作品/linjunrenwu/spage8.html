          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nowadays, artificial intelligence is more and more mentioned and applied by everyone, but what is artificial intelligence, machine learning and machine vision? For artificial intelligence and its subdivisions, such as machine vision, few people can say Be clear about what they are and how they work.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s71.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dr. Wang Guotian explained:</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artificial Intelligence, abbreviated as AI in English. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is a new technical science that studies and develops theories, methods, techniques, and applications that simulate, extend, and extend human intelligence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that attempts to understand the essence of intelligence and produce a new intelligent machine that responds in a manner similar to human intelligence. Research in this area includes robotics, speech recognition, image recognition, Natural language processing and expert systems.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Machine Learning (ML) is a research branch of artificial intelligence. It mainly designs and analyzes some algorithms that allow calculation and automatic acquisition of knowledge, involving multiple fields such as probability theory, statistics, and approximation.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deep Learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning. Deep learning is a new field in machine learning research. Its motivation lies in establishing and simulating the neural network for human brain analysis and learning. It mimics the mechanism of human brain. To interpret data such as images, sounds, and text. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like machine learning methods, in-depth machine learning methods also have supervised learning and unsupervised learning.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a face recognition expert, Dr. Wang Guotian pointed out that the learning models established under different learning frameworks are very different. For example, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a deep machine learning model under supervised learning. Deep Belief Nets (DBNs) is a machine learning model under unsupervised learning.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, in simple terms, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are an inclusion relationship. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are constantly approaching the essence of artificial intelligence through the exploration of computing power and computing methods - a smart body with self-learning and resilience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But we can't simply think that artificial intelligence just makes the mathematical model more accurate. It is a long process to make the machine have the ability to anthropomorphize: after all, from the birth of the computer to the current mobile Internet, we have spent 70 years. After immersing in the field of face recognition technology for more than 20 years, Dr. Wang Guotian, a face recognition expert, has a deep understanding of this matter.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s72.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dr. Wang Guotian said: Big data and machine learning have made computers so smart that computers can outperform human limit capabilities in certain areas, such as Google AlphaGo, which defeated World Champion Li Shishi, and the purpose of artificial intelligence. It is definitely not to let computers and humans play chess. It can be said that in the next few decades, the intelligent revolution brought about by big data will be faced, and machines will gain more and more comprehensive capabilities.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in fact, the scope of application of artificial intelligence is profound, cumbersome and complex, and applications in every vertical field need to overcome unimaginable obstacles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we first split the function of the brain and let the machine be smarter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The human brain needs to use various senses, such as eyes and ears, to perceive external information, and then make judgments. This uses machines instead of human eyes to do measurement and judgment. It is called machine vision, and machine vision is artificial intelligence. The fastest branch of development, and today's well-known face recognition technology is one of the most challenging topics of machine vision.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the field of face recognition, Dr. Wang Guotian particularly emphasized that traditional face features are manually selected, such as SIFT, HOG, etc., but manually selecting features is a very laborious task, and the quality of selected features depends heavily on In terms of experience and luck, deep learning is a method of unsupervised learning automatic learning features that can better express samples. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Face recognition has broad application prospects and scientific research value because of its non-invasiveness, convenience, security and other characteristics. Therefore, the face learning method using deep learning method can be used in lighting, expression, attitude and Problems such as low resolution are improved.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s73.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the view of face recognition expert Dr. Wang Guotian, the face recognition method based on deep learning is based on the sparse self-encoding neural network and softmax classifier to construct a deep hierarchical network, and the deep hierarchical network is trained. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to verify the face recognition rate of the deep learning method, the algorithm is evaluated on the ORL, Yale, Yale-B and PERET face databases. The test content includes softmax classifier face recognition, deep network top-level fine-tuning algorithm and deep network overall fine-tuning. Three aspects of the algorithm. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The preprocessing of the face images of each database includes histogram equalization, non-local mean algorithm, wavelet transform processing, Retinex image enhancement algorithm and homomorphic filtering algorithm. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, the low-resolution problem was further verified using the deep network overall fine-tuning algorithm. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finally, a face recognition system based on sparse self-encoding neural network and softmax classifier is implemented by using matlab GUI. The depth hierarchy of the system is adjustable in level and node, and has complete recognition function.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dr. Wang Guotian concluded that the experimental results show that the deep learning method has an efficient and accurate abstract representation of the original data, and has achieved good performance under the conditions of illumination, expression, attitude and low resolution, especially in the case of low resolution.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the powerful algorithm is not combined with the actual application scenario, it is no different from the paper. In addition to the promotion of rankings and infinitely close to 100% of the experimental results, it does not bring actual value, but also talk about social benefits. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The original intention of artificial intelligence is to replace human resources and liberate human beings to create more value. Face recognition technology should also follow this basic principle. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, with the development of technology and the rapid growth of market demand, face has already played such value in many fields, such as face recognition attendance access control, remote online nuclear body, and the need to replace the human and material resources in the real-name scene with brush face. . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Applications in security, such as dynamic monitoring of public places, capture of fugitives, and personnel control.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the end, from the perspective of a face recognition expert, Dr. Wang Guotian affirmed that the artificial intelligence's face recognition ability far exceeds that of human beings compared to the efficiency of the human eye. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this does not mean that the machine will not go wrong. Therefore, in the special vocabulary that accurately describes the pass rate of face recognition, there is a word of misunderstanding rate. In the case of non-Science, it can completely achieve the rate of misunderstanding in one ten thousand. The pass rate is 98% and can meet the application scenarios in daily life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, the meaning of artificial intelligence is to empower humans to work more efficiently and to help humans work more efficiently than to replace humans.</font></font></p>
