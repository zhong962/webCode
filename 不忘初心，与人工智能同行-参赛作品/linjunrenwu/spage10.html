          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wu Hua: I have been doing natural language processing. The voice interaction is divided into two parts, one is speech recognition, and the other is voice separation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Natural language processing technology has always been a branch of artificial intelligence, so before introducing natural language processing, I will briefly review artificial intelligence. Academician Zhang Bo is underneath. I am a classman, which is weak artificial intelligence, strong artificial intelligence, and super artificial intelligence. We are at this stage now, and super artificial intelligence is still in the fantasy stage. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A brief review of the development of artificial intelligence, from the concept of artificial intelligence in 1956, has now passed the full 60th anniversary, and then there are two ups and downs. In the 1980s, there was an expert system that achieved great success. But then it was silent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the real development of the era is that in 1997, IBM's deep blue computer defeated Go, which proves that humans have surpassed humans in some fields. After that, IBM's question and answer system and this year's Alpha dog are all beyond the unilateral ability. People, this artificial dream is still in the era of weak intelligence artificial.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Next, I will review the development of natural language processing technology. Natural language processing technology is a branch of artificial intelligence, so he has three main dimensions, one is the germination period, and the natural language processing technology cannot be separated from the development of machine translation. First, 1947 The concept of machine translation memorandum was put forward. In 1956, the formal language theory was put forward. After the reaction period was also entered into the 70-based rule translation method, Haye’s human-computer interaction system in 1972 was based on formal theory, followed by prosperity, benefiting. Some data has been obtained on the development of the Internet, so that this translation method based on statistics has been greatly developed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A statistical-based translation method was proposed in 1991.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We see that these developments are just related to the Internet. One is big data, the other is the growth of storage and computing power. Just mentioned the gene sequencing just in the morning, it is actually several hundred years before five years ago, now It can be completed in a thousand dollars. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The development of the Internet is inseparable from products, data, technology, and a variety of smart products that appear on the Internet. These products can produce a variety of data, which in turn promotes the development of technology, which in turn enables The more people use this smart product, so the cycle is repeated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Internet is not yet understood. Let's look at the example of machine translation. The first example has difficulty finding a policeman. It is difficult to translate the police. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let’s take a look at the smart assistants now, or an area that is very hot now, but let’s look at this chat example. Basically, we still don’t understand the human language. Under this trend, let’s look at the technology behind it. That's it, because the technology behind us is mainly deep learning, which is an example of deep learning for machine translation, such as the use of computational models in machine translation, molecular identification, etc. Did not reach understanding. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then let's look at what is based on the current challenge and let the machine think like a human. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, we have to do intelligent search. Then we need to deeply understand the user's language. First, let's look at the relationship between knowledge base understanding and reasoning. The first reason we need to do is that we need two kinds of knowledge, one is factual knowledge, and the other is Conceptual knowledge, factual representation mainly includes YAGO, satori and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Query reasoning, who wrote the Journey to the West, in fact, this is a very simple example, but he is actually the author of the conversion to the Journey to the West, where conceptual and factual knowledge, especially verb meaning, is used. The explanation, so when we were in Baidu, we made some representations of concepts, such as the word treatment, related semantics and downward relationship, an aggregated relationship, a combined relationship, if you have this knowledge, you can do it just now. The semantic understanding of Qurey. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is an example here. We use this knowledge base as a Query to understand, for example, which ticket is booked. This is an example when I was using it at the time, reminding me of the flight ticket from Beijing to Nanjing tomorrow. It is set successfully, in addition to the knowledge base-based relationship reasoning, that is to say, the relationship is more complicated, for example, there is a sister, one is the same mother</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Setting a plane ticket is a very certain task. He only needs to know the starting point, destination and time. I can set up a knowledge base for the airline ticket in Beijing's knowledge base, but it is different in the query. Establish a dialogue system, our dialogue system based on the intention map. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's take a quick look. For example, Alaska actually has an uprising. One is a place name and the other is a dog. We build such a map. We can make a big guide like this. It is all through our intention map. The intention map is not effective alone. We use some machine learning progress, such as the click feedback we use. This is to enhance the facts and learn to combine. This example can be seen. After combining machine learning and intentional graphs, we believe that Users will have more and more clicks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Based on the intelligent recommendation of the label map, personalized advancement, we are the relationship between the user's interest and the document. We connect through the label, we are related through the label network, that is to say the label map, let's look at a simple example. This is related to population intelligence. He has an entity relationship. In addition to these relationships, we have topic tags. The topic tag means that the economy is based on various news on the Internet, and this topic is really of concern to users. So we added the topic tag, so we can now see a variety of tags in Baidu's app, which may be related to your personal interests, you can pay attention.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, in addition to this kind of thinking and understanding, human intelligence has a great skill to create, to write poetry, to write articles, and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, when we were doing this project, it was similar to the Turing test. The person who wanted to distinguish the left and right poems was written by humans and written by robots. At that time, they basically deceived all science students. In fact, there are two processes in the writing of poetry. One is the theme planning. Therefore, it is very important to write poetry. Planning is very important. If you don’t plan, the theme will go wrong. At the time, we used it only to do the theme planning. If you only write poetry, it will be irrelevant to the theme. The first sentence in front is related, and the latter is irrelevant. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our process based on the theme planning is like this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(English) actually expands on her subject, it is also a knowledge. This knowledge is not very structured knowledge. For example, we use two kinds of knowledge, one is Baidu Encyclopedia, one is using advertising words, some are some companies. Announcement words, each qur expands four subject words, each corresponding to a topic, so that each of them is very relevant. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the poet model is actually based on deep learning that we can often see, but with a little distortion, the left side is the theme, and the right side is the program to generate the next sentence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We can also use the voice to watch in Baidu APP, and write poetry for you to generate such a poem. Any quarry can be.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Big data and computing power help artificial intelligence embark on the road to recovery. Next I hope that knowledge base, natural language processing and machine learning can be combined to help artificial intelligence move toward understanding.</font></font></p>
