          <h1 class="title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Virtual personal assistant gives people a smart life</font></font></h1>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone wants to have a caring personal assistant to help with all kinds of chores. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In many sci-fi movies, there have been scenes of virtual personal assistant services entering human life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the era of mobile Internet, the demand for assistant services is highlighted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The continuous development of information and communication technology is gradually breaking through the imagination of human beings. People are using new technical means to obtain "good secretary" or "good housekeeping" services. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In reality, more and more "non-human" assistants have emerged around people to help with day-to-day affairs.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A virtual personal assistant is a powerful software application that has a deep understanding of people's needs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It can replace people in performing certain tasks – by integrating these services in some way to optimally meet people's needs.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The virtual personal assistant provides assistant services to people in three steps: receiving information, analyzing searches, and performing tasks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The virtual personal assistant “discovers” people's needs through human orders or according to people's itinerary, habits and other monitoring data, and then through comprehensive analysis, searches for “services” that best meet people's needs, and then performs tasks for people.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Virtual personal assistants collect and record data about individuals and families to provide effective services. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the results of data accumulation, that is, people's habits, preferences, and needs, appropriate services are provided for people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The virtual personal assistant cyclically applies relevant data and adjusts the habits, preferences and demand records of people according to changes in the environment, personal and family life status, and dynamically optimizes the “intelligent” personal assistant service. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Virtual personal assistants can also become a "control center" according to people's wishes, and arrange people's lives in all aspects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Virtual personal assistants can be a key node for human beings to connect with everything, and humans will be freed from chores and choices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Evolving artificial intelligence will make virtual personal assistants stronger, and excellent virtual personal assistants can even learn some of the complex “soft skills” that humans have, not only helping people with daily affairs, but also helping people make vital things. decision.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nowadays, artificial intelligence has been promoted and used in more and more industries, and it has become an important scientific and technological means to improve people's quality of life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The virtual personal assistant will be the core product of the "artificial intelligence +" era of Internet applications. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A variety of mobile applications make smartphones a “universal machine”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the "clouding" of mobile applications, people will not need to download any mobile applications, just install a virtual personal assistant. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will do a good job for everyone, and provide more practical services by connecting to the cloud mobile app. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The virtual personal assistant combines with the TV set-top box to convert people from "watching TV" mode to "using TV" mode. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People can use voice to talk to virtual personal assistants, and enjoy practical smart services such as finding videos, searching for information, on-demand, weather inquiries, and appointment reminders. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The virtual personal assistant will act as a search engine, searching for people, and people will no longer "look at the vast amount of information." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Virtual personal assistants will create a more powerful world of data networks and become a super-entry to the future, truly changing people's lives. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Future virtual personal assistants will be smarter and understand and answer questions like a real-life assistant. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because it is based on the cloud, it can be continuously learned and updated through a huge database, and by analyzing relevant data, it analyzes various problems faced by people and provides solutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Future virtual personal assistants will be more privately tailored to provide more targeted advice for different people, as well as for a variety of mobile phones, tablets or wearables.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The future development of virtual personal assistants is promising, but there are still many problems that need to be solved and solved. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The current bottlenecks mainly include artificial intelligence algorithms such as basic data collection, opening and natural language processing, and automatic reasoning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, the promotion and application of virtual personal assistants, in addition to their own development breakthroughs, depends on the development of related technologies such as Internet of Things and artificial intelligence.</font></font></p>
