          <div class="one">
            <img src="./zimg/z31.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">

          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same two-dimensional medical image, such as pathological section, may take a few minutes or ten minutes for the doctor to reason, and the deep-learned artificial intelligence can be "read" in just a few tens of seconds. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“In the future, in providing fast and accurate medical image diagnosis, artificial intelligence can at least increase the diagnostic speed by 10 times, or at least reduce the cost by 10 times under the same performance.” Today, Professor of Zhejiang University Medical College, Shanghai Industrial Technology Research Institute Professor Qian Dahong revealed at the Jinqiao Industrial Technology Innovation Conference held by the Fudan University Affiliated Tumor Hospital and the Shanghai Industrial Technology Research Institute.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">IBM's "Doctor Watson" not only diagnoses rare diseases, but also provides different treatment options and confidence indicators at the time of diagnosis. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What does Ma Yun say, “Let the doctors lose their jobs after 30 years” become a reality?</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artificial intelligence has advantages for "reading" films</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the history of medical image-assisted diagnosis is earlier than we imagined. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the 1980s, artificial neural networks were first used in CADX (Computer Aided Drawing System). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In other words, people wanted to imitate neural network systems to solve real problems decades ago. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, most of the attempts at that time focused on mimicking a single neuron structure, or a shallow neural network.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In recent years, the deep learning of artificial intelligence has broken through the limitations of computer vision and pattern recognition, and CADX based on deep learning has emerged. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For artificial intelligence, the characteristics of deep learning are automatically generated by the machine based on the output, and the different features are only different parameters. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, those who have a large amount of structured data as training, the features are not obvious to the average person, and it is difficult to extract the fields using biostatistics and the like, and the artificial intelligence can be used to assist the diagnosis.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“This is very similar to training a doctor. You need to learn a lot of medical textbooks and cases. The computer already has the ability to remember and reason. Currently, artificial intelligence is used to identify two-dimensional medical images such as retina, endoscope, pathology and chest. The film has advantages and the effect is better.” Qian Dahong introduced that his team used some open public data, combined with a self-developed system, to accurately diagnose the diabetic retinopathy and skin cancer in the laboratory. Up to 94%.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artificial intelligence, in the final analysis, is the service of clinical and adjuvant therapy</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">IBM's "Doctor Watson" is now well known in the medical world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to a report by Japan's "Tokyo News" last year, a 60-year-old woman was initially diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, but after various treatments, the effect was not obvious. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Later, Dr. Watson diagnosed a rare leukemia in 10 minutes by comparing 20 million cancer research papers and proposed a treatment plan.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artificial intelligence is increasingly involved in medical care. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Early screening for low-dose CT lung cancer in the United States began using software certified by the US Food and Drug Administration; US insurance companies have recently begun to require CAD/CADX software for doctors of breast cancer mammography.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Right now, IBM's "Doctor Watson" began to promote in China. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Qian Dahong's view, it is "more like a smart database that can be quickly retrieved, and it is likely to be challenged by a more democratic deep learning system." At the same time, he still has a question, "Doctor Watson" mainly collects white. Human data, while Chinese are yellow people, do you need to re-collect data?</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With artificial intelligence, will doctors be laid off in the future? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Qian Dahong believes that "artificial intelligence is ultimately a service for clinical and adjuvant treatment, and doctors cannot be unemployed!" Although artificial intelligence has a good effect on the recognition of two-dimensional medical images, "there are very active research on three-dimensional and four-dimensional medical images." But there is no breakthrough.” Moreover, artificial intelligence only gives a conclusion. The lack of “inference process” is a bit “rough”, which is also a place where clinicians are not satisfied. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"In the future, artificial intelligence must have a greater role in medical care, not only with the doctor to get the data, but also by the doctor to mark the training. Training itself is a long process."</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">May have a breakthrough in imaging</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the present China, it is a normal state for patients from all over the world to take medical images to the top three hospitals in the big cities to find experts to “look at them”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this meeting, many experts believe that the widespread application of artificial intelligence in the medical field may have a breakthrough in imaging.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wang Gan, a researcher at the School of Biomedical Engineering at Shanghai Jiaotong University, said that according to MICCAI data, more than 70% of medical image research work in 2016 used machine learning intelligence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"People can't be single-minded, but computers can." He introduced a work the team is doing to integrate NMR and CT to achieve CT-guided precision radiotherapy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, they also used preoperative imaging data to predict the survival of patients with glioma.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just last month, Shanghai Jiaotong University and Shanghai Lianying Medical Technology Co., Ltd. signed a contract to jointly establish the "Advanced Research Institute of Medical Imaging". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Du Yiping, the president of the hospital, said that the school will invest a total of 250 million yuan, aiming to build a leading international leading edge technology and lead the innovative research and technology transformation of medical imaging technology in China.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“I hope that in the next three to five years, we will gradually establish a large database of structured medical images for the Chinese people's independent standards. With the new methodology, the vertical intelligent diagnosis module for certain diseases will be put into practical use.” Discourse, Qian Dahong Confident in the future of artificial intelligence.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“In the past year, the application concept of artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, in medical assisted diagnosis is very hot, but there is almost no clinical use. One of the main reasons is that artificial intelligence systems cannot maintain their test data sets in complex clinical applications. The high accuracy rate, the collection and pretreatment of clinical medical data is not perfect, and the doctor's workflow is not taken into account.” Huang Wei, director of the Biomedical Transformation Center of the Shanghai Industrial Technology Research Institute, said that the topic of artificial intelligence at the conference was To address these issues, explore the promotion of closer collaboration between clinical medicine and artificial intelligence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the future, the two sides will choose a number of suitable artificial intelligence to cut in, the goal is to make a truly meaningful artificial intelligence system.</font></font></p>
