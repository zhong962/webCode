            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Throughout the 2018 classroom, it is easy to ignore the changes that technology has brought to the learning style over the past decade. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tables, whiteboards, and rows of chairs are still the same, but many invisible changes have taken place.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today, one-third of schools in the UK require students to bring their tablets or laptops to the classroom. The coding course has been a national project for three years, with more and more education through applications and digital services. Conducted outside the school. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But these changes are just the beginning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artificial intelligence is the next big leap in the field of education and learning. We have not seen any substantial changes based on the people working in education and technology.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ian Fordham, chief executive of Edtech UK, a UK education technology strategy agency, said: "Some technologies in education have potential but are not capable of achieving or changing." "The latest developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning are A major exception is that it has the potential to change how young people learn, how teachers and mentors teach, and how society can drive future learning forward."</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No AI will replace the teacher</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whether it is a group of tech entrepreneurs including Tesla's Elon Musk and PayPal's Peter Thiel, they are committed to investing $1 billion in OpenAI. For the benefit of all mankind, or Google's DeepMind defeated the best Go players in the world, the huge investment and energy in the field of artificial intelligence is undeniable, and like the greatest efforts of mankind - it is now entering the school classroom .</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, forget the concept of any robot replacing the teacher. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, in education, human teachers will be very important in promoting and developing artificial intelligence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tom Hooper, founder of Third Space Learning, said: "Artificial intelligence does not replace teachers, it will support them and guide them to become better teachers."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Founded in 2012, “Third Space Learning” provides one-on-one math tutoring on the Internet by connecting children to teachers around the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since its inception, nearly 6,000 students with mathematics difficulties in nearly 350 British schools have signed up for “Third Space Learning”.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What's really amazing is what Hooper and his team are going to do next. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He said: "We record every lesson, with thousands of hours of instructional data per week - and this is also a lot of data about interpersonal interactions."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“About 12 months ago, we conducted a research project with University College London to study the patterns of positive teaching outcomes and how we can optimize teaching interactions to promote best practices.”</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By raising the teaching to a certain level, the ultimate goal of “Third Space Learning” is to establish a platform that provides online teachers with real-time feedback and makes them better educators. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Suppose a child misunderstands a core mathematical concept, or the teacher accidentally skips something. Artificial intelligence can notify the teacher in advance of the fact that it becomes obstructed during the child's learning process.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hooper said: "If we can shape the performance of teachers - teachers are an important input to children's learning - then you create something really powerful." He envisioned such a world, every teacher, whether in the classroom Still outside the classroom, they are all guided by an artificial intelligence, and the artificial intelligence itself has been trained from the learning of millions of classes.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why do our classrooms need artificial intelligence?</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One reason is the size of the class. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the current average size of classrooms in the UK is 26 students, while the international average is 21. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, the recent education statistics department shows that in England, 500,000 primary school students are educated in classes of 31 or more students.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“The impact on teachers is naked: how do they provide the teaching experience that meets each child's needs?” Junaid Mubeen, head of Whizz Education's “digital maths tutor” product, said, “Our research shows that in classrooms around the world. There may be a learning gap of four years between students."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That's why the virtual math tutors like Whizz Education and Gojimo's free exam revision app are becoming more popular because of their increased popularity. They provide students with more personalized education outside the classroom. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whizz Education claims that spending one hour a week with their AI assistants in each school year can help them learn more than their peers for 18 months.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Similarly, an independent university study in 2012 found that using the free Duolingo language learning app to learn Spanish for 34 hours was equivalent to studying a full semester at the university. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if they are already so powerful, why are these AI-powered learning systems used only by a small number of students?</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Artificial intelligence is plagued by image problems in education,” said Mubeen of Whizz Education. “With the rise of intelligent coaching systems, educators have to face their own survival crisis: whether the machine can teach, this is another What does it mean?"</font></font></p>

            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AI education is a gradually expanding trend</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Resistance is common, but it is wrong. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He said: "In 15 to 20 years, artificial intelligence instructors will be as popular as car insurance. These instructors will interact emotionally with children through voice interaction products to solve problems and develop a more targeted learning path for each student. ”</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although accompanied by the pioneering work of Whizz Education, third space learning, Gojimo, Duolingo and other teams are pushing artificial intelligence into mainstream education, it is undeniable that this is still a work in progress.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Despite nearly three decades of work experience, AIEd is still a family industry in many respects, and the benefits and great potential in this area have not yet been released,” Pearson, the education giant, reported in 2015. In the middle, "unfortunately, many of the best ideas currently in AIEd are limited to laboratories, or even just a lecture hall."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As the population continues to grow, not only in the UK, but also in countries such as India and Japan, AI education is not only an option, it is fast becoming a necessity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today's teachers are already struggling because the size of the class exceeds the limit of 30 students per teacher. This is a huge challenge and it seems to be getting worse.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artificial intelligence, like previous educational techniques, may not change tables, blackboards, and rows of chairs as much as learning changes, but it may change everything else. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Teachers make themselves more efficient educators through smart assistants; students receive tailored learning support, and learning opportunities offered by AI inside and outside the classroom, they will stand out.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The question that remains a lot of attention in the field of education is that once artificial intelligence is firmly established, who will be needed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stanford University is the birthplace of dozens of artificial intelligence start-ups, and has launched a research project, "Artificial Intelligence Centennial Research." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among them, the main artificial intelligence expert group of the project unambiguously emphasized the importance of teachers: “In the next 15 years, a typical North American city, intelligent tutors and other artificial intelligence technologies will assist teachers in class and help students under the class. , will be a trend of gradual expansion."</font></font></p>
