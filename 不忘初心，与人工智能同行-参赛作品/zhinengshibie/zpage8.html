            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since 2016, machine vision and collaborative robots have become hot spots due to the intelligent upgrade of robots. However, in the first half of 2018, cooperative robots have obviously a tendency to weaken, but machine vision has been heating up all the way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, machine vision companies with large amounts of financing are looking for a quick landing, and in the future, how many fresh “faces” will emerge in this emerging field? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many people in the industry have shouted that the machine vision has arrived, and will break out in the next 3-5 years.</font></font></p>
            <h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Capital boosts a hundred schools of thought</font></font></h2>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the industrial robot industry or the industrial robot-related enterprises, which type of enterprise financing the most, the most frequent, non-machine vision enterprises. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From 2017 to the first half of 2018, according to incomplete statistics, there were nearly 20 machine vision enterprise financing events, and in the previous communication with investors, they also expressed interest in machine vision enterprises.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From January 2018 to the present, 11 companies focused on machine vision, including Aqiu Technology, Elegance Vision, Vision Technology, Lipper Technology, and High Vision Technology, have received financing from 8 million to 100 million yuan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among them, in the field of industrial machine vision: In January, Aqiu Technology completed a $8 million Series A financing; at the end of February, Elegance Vision received tens of millions of Pre-A rounds of financing; in early July, Lipper Technology completed 50 million A+ rounds of financing In mid-July, Gaoshi Technology won 50 million A+ rounds of financing.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, China is becoming one of the most active regions in the world for machine vision development. It is the third largest machine vision market in the world after the United States and Japan, and its application covers almost all industries of the national economy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As the processing center of the global manufacturing industry, the industrial field is the largest proportion of machine vision applications, and many internationally advanced machine vision systems and application experience have also entered China.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the help of capital, China's machine vision market has accelerated its fermentation, and it has formed a situation of "hundred schools of thought." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the survey of China Machine Vision Industry Alliance (CMVU), there are nearly 200 international machine vision brands that have entered China. There are more than 100 machine vision brands in China, and machine vision products have surpassed all kinds of agents. There are more than 300 professional machine vision system integrators.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this context, machine vision hardware equipment suppliers represented by Hikvision, Huarui Technology, Cognex, OPT, etc. are also stepping up the layout of the industrial market, with Cooper, Mecamand, The machine vision professional solution providers represented by Aqiu Technology and others, in the context of clarifying their respective technological advantages, are accelerating their landing in various sub-segments in combination with process characteristics.</font></font></p>
            <h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accelerate the landing of the princes</font></font></h2>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By providing professional machine vision solutions and finding the grounding scenes of machine vision, each machine vision enterprise has formed a situation of "legal separation."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the current situation, the application of machine vision in the industrial field is mainly concentrated in the process sections of product inspection, disorder sorting, loading and unloading, unloading and stacking, and gluing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among them, in the field of product testing, companies including Gaoshi Technology, Lipper Technology, Elegance Vision, and Aqiu Technology have been gathered. In the field of sorting, Mekamand, Cooper, Elson, Entropy Technology, Enterprises such as Qiu Technology have their own advantages.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, in the handling of AGV logistics, because of the development of e-commerce logistics, it has become a hotspot of corporate competition. In addition to giant companies such as Hikvision, start-ups such as Far Time and Desperate Technology are also eyeing this. Block "fat".</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Visual inspection</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the process of high-tech robots patrolling research, the detection link has become a bottleneck for automation transformation as a part of the 3C industry, especially the mobile phone industry, which has a large number of workers and takes a long time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, in the industrial field, the demand for machine vision inspection is huge.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is reported that in many industrial products, quality inspection is a full inspection, which means that every product must be inspected. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just like mobile phone screens, China has to produce 2.1 billion mobile phone screens every year, each of which has to be inspected, and each screen has to pass 8 tests. Because it is very difficult, it is currently subject to manual testing. People need about 30-40 million.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Founded in 2016, Aqiu Technology focuses on the development of CV &amp; Robotics' underlying technology. One of its main lines of business is the machine-based visual inspection system, which is mainly used in 3C electronics and auto parts industries.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the field of machine vision inspection, Gaoshi Technology, Elegance Vision, and Lipper Technology all received financing this year. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The business focus of the company is focused on the display industry, mobile phone and cover, lithium battery industry; while elite vision is mainly focused on the mobile phone, packaging, PCB and automotive manufacturing industries; the same is machine vision detection, Lipper technology will look It is placed in new materials, new energy, high-end auto parts, fast-food food and clothing accessories.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, it is necessary to point out that in addition to promoting the upstream and downstream expansion of the original OLED main line business of LCD (OLED, LCD), Vision Technology is also committed to achieving new energy, semiconductor packaging and testing, precision vision measurement, PCB inspection, etc. Multiple new performance growth point layouts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In other words, in the field of 3C electronics, new energy and auto parts, the competition for visual inspection will be fierce.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is worth noting that the application of machine vision inspection in these four companies emphasizes the combination of deep learning and machine vision. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Image Technology uses advanced technologies such as bionics and deep learning for image processing; Lipper Technology combines AI and machine vision as a competitive advantage, allowing inspection equipment to simulate the human brain and give the device wisdom; and the elite vision established in 2017 Has patented visual inspection technology for appearance defects based on deep learning.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, Vision Technology and Lipper Technology also emphasized the importance of data for the performance improvement and improvement of testing equipment. Therefore, while providing testing equipment, both companies emphasized the importance of data services.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Logistics sorting</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, industrial robots can only complete the capture of fixed-mode objects, and more than 90% of the identification and sorting of complex stacked objects are done manually, which greatly limits the efficiency of industrial production.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Founded in 2016, Mecamand completed three rounds of financing in just one year. Cooper, also established in 2016, also completed the third round of financing at the end of last year. Coincidentally, both companies are not. Order sorting field layout.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mecamand uses cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning, 3D vision and intelligent path planning to introduce a variety of commodity classification systems and a wide variety of goods classification systems to support a wide range of goods of different sizes and types, as well as for reflective, Dark, with a complex pattern of goods, the goods can be closely fitted, or can be placed at will.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cooper's mushroom intelligent classification system is currently the only food-grade sorting system in China. This system can identify 26 kinds of mushrooms, and the picking speed can reach 0.8s/piece, and the precision rate can reach 99.7%.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to Mecamand and Cooper, Entropy Technology also uses its 3D vision and autonomous path planning techniques for visual sorting of robots; and for 3D recognition and positioning of scattered and disorderly stacked workpieces, Elson also launched The AT-D100 logistics 3D intelligent sorting and positioning system; in addition to the visual inspection system, another major business line of Aqiu Technology is the intelligent sorting system of 3D vision.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the specific application scenarios, the logistics industry has become the focus of competition among enterprises. Cooper said that its mushroom intelligent classification system can also be applied in the logistics industry; currently, Mecamand has already cooperated with some logistics and robotic ontology companies. Many projects are also being shipped through some robotics and logistics equipment integrators.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As early as last year, the Elson AT-S1000 robot 3D positioning system has been applied to Jingdong's “unmanned warehouse”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, the projects that Enqizhi Technology has already implemented are mainly cooperating with some well-known daily chemical, logistics and e-commerce companies.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Other fields</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AGV technology mainly focuses on vision, positioning and navigation, motion control, cluster scheduling, etc. The current popularity of the AGV industry has also driven the development of visual SLAM enterprises.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On January 31 this year, the far-flung time and space that announced the completion of the tens of millions of RMB Pre-A round financing was mainly focused on the research and development and productization of visual SLAM, and deepened the application of logistics robots with vision as the core; and on April 8, Face++ Technology's wholly-owned acquisition of Ares robot is also aimed at realizing its vision technology in the field of AGV and entering the field of logistics and handling.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to these areas, machine vision technology is also commonly used in the fields of loading and unloading, smashing, squeezing, and gluing. At present, most robotic ontology companies and systems are involved in machine vision in these fields. technology.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is worth mentioning that, in December 2015, Yi Shi Zhiyi took visual intelligence and motion control – “intelligent control” integrated solution as its unique competitive advantage. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vision's VMC series visual dispensing system integrates the functions of visual perception, motion control and dispensing execution of the dispensing process, which can be easily integrated with various actuators to form a terminal dispenser product in one step. The need for seed line dispensing.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In recent years, Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macao and Dawan District have exerted a lot of efforts in creating new engines for innovation and driving technological innovation to promote resource agglomeration. Innovation mechanisms, industrial upgrading, talent drainage and coordinated development have brought many opportunities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Correspondingly, artificial intelligence and talent empowerment are profoundly affecting the pace of business.</font></font></p>
