						<p>Image recognition technology is an important field of artificial intelligence.It refers to the object recognition of images to identify different patterns of objects and image technology.In the process of image recognition, the perceptual mechanism must exclude the redundant information input and extract the key information.At the same time, there must be a mechanism in the brain responsible for integrating information, which can organize the information acquired in stages into a complete perceptual map.</p>
						<p>There are many methods of image segmentation, such as threshold segmentation, edge detection, region extraction and segmentation based on specific theoretical tools.The types of images can be divided into gray image segmentation, color image segmentation and texture image segmentation.</p>

						<h4><a href="">Fingerprint identification technology</a></h4>
						<p>Fingerprint recognition is to identify the details by comparing different fingerprint features. Fingerprint recognition technology involves image processing, pattern recognition, computer vision, mathematical morphology, wavelet analysis and many other disciplines. Because each person's fingerprints are different, that is, between the same person's ten fingers, fingerprints also have obvious differences, so fingerprints can be used for identification. Because the orientation of each printing is not exactly the same, different focus will bring varying degrees of deformation.</p>

						<h4><a href="">Palm-print recognition technology</a></h4>
						<p>Palm-print recognition is a new biometric recognition technology in recent years.Palmprint is an image of the palm of the hand from the end of the finger to the wrist.Many of these features can be used for identification: mainline, wrinkles, fine texture, ridge tip, bifurcation point, etc.Palm-print recognition system is the same in structure as other biometric recognition systems, but palm-print recognition is a non-invasive method compared with fingerprint recognition, which is more acceptable to users and less demanding for acquisition equipment.</p>

						<h4><a href="">Face recognition technology</a></h4>
						<p>Face recognition is a hot research field of computer technology. It belongs to the biometric recognition technology, which differentiates the biological characteristics of organisms (generally referring to human beings).The generalized face recognition actually includes a series of related technologies for constructing face recognition system, including face image acquisition, face location, face recognition preprocessing, identity verification and identity search.In the narrow sense, face recognition refers to the technology or system of identifying or finding identity through face.</p>

						<h4><a href="">Iris recognition technology</a></h4>
						<p>Iris recognition is an eye-related biometric technology that has less interference with humans.It USES fairly ordinary camera components and does not require user contact with the machine.In addition, it has the ability to achieve higher template matching performance.Therefore, it attracts the attention of all kinds of people.After the development of the fetus, the iris will remain unchanged throughout life.The uniqueness of iris features also determines the uniqueness of identity recognition.Therefore, the iris feature of the eye can be used as an identification object for everyone.</p>

						<h4><a href="">Fingerprint identification technology</a></h4>
						<p>It is believed that with the improvement of fingerprint identification technology, it will be widely used in more fields such as id card, automobile and household.In the next five years, China will have a market of nearly 10 billion yuan waiting for enterprises to expand.The huge market prospect of fingerprint identification technology will exert great influence on the international and domestic security industry.Smaller firms will face stiff competition from new entrants into traditional industries, big companies.In the face of these big names, it is hard to say that existing small and medium-sized companies have too much competitiveness, the industry reshuffle is inevitable, and merger and exit may become the helpless choice of most small and medium-sized companies.Eventually, companies or large capital in traditional industries may dominate the biometric identification industry in a relatively short time.Of course, it is not out of the question that some of the core competitive companies grow into the big emerging companies by "eating the fast fish and the slow fish"."Big fish" and "fast fish" coexist, which is also the inevitable result of every emerging market.The result of competition will be a big new industry.</p>

						<h4><a href="">Face recognition technology</a></h4>
						<p>With the development of face recognition technology, market demand will be released and application scenarios will be explored.From social security to campus access, from remote pre-credit to security screening, face recognition is opening up the market.With the accelerated popularity of face recognition applications, the industry will also present a new development trend.The technology innovation is the fundamental reason for the rapid development of face recognition market.Deep learning improves the accuracy of face recognition to the level of naked eye, which greatly enriches the application scenarios of face recognition.The Internet bank needs to bring face recognition into the financial application scene.The giant's frequent layout of face recognition gives it more room to imagine application scenarios, while cultivating users' "face brushing" habits and recognition of the technology, which is conducive to the further development of the industry.The application of face recognition has been developed explosively with the help of multiple factors.With the rapid development of China's social economy, the application of face recognition technology will be more and more demanding.</p>

					<div class="w3-agile-news-images" style="width: 100%">
						<h4><a href="">Iris recognition technology</a></h4>
						<p>In recent years, iris recognition has developed in two directions.One direction is to develop towards the far direction and the direction of multi-mode, which means to integrate the biological features of face and other modes to realize the recognition under walking state when the distance reaches several meters.In recent years, for example, Carnegie Mellon university's center for biometrics has developed a remote iris scanner that can recognize a distance of up to 12 meters, allowing a car's iris to be read quickly when the owner's eyes inadvertently sweep the rearview mirror.What it does: the computer system that connects the camera will match the picture of savvides' iris against its database, and then accurately display savedes' name and other identity information.If the technology is applied to police, it could help police identify drivers more quickly and safely.Can be used to identify suspects who are on the run and trying to escape by changing their appearance;It can also undertake security work at the airport and other important ports.</p>

						<h4><a href="">GOOGLE launches AI voice synthesizer and DEEPMIND AI offers support</a></h4>
						<p>Google is launching a new AI voice synthesizer as part of its suite of machine learning cloud tools.A service called cloud text to voice will be available to any developer or enterprise who needs speech synthesis, whether it be an application, a website, or a virtual assistant.Interestingly, Cloud text-to-speech is supported by WaveNet, which was created by Google's AI subsidiary DeepMind in the UK.Since Google acquired DeepMind in 2014, it has been exploring how to turn the company's AI talent into a tangible product.DeepMind's algorithm has now cut the cost of power in Google's data centres by 40%, and DeepMind is moving into health care.But it may be more important to integrate WaveNet directly into its cloud services, especially as Google tries to win the cloud business from amazon and Microsoft.Second, DeepMind's AI speech synthesis technology is one of the most advanced and realistic technologies in the industry.Google says the new service offers 32 different kinds of voice and allows users to customize factors such as pitch and speed.</p>
