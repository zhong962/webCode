          <h1 class="title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Robots empower intelligent education</font></font></h1>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this exhibition hall of the World Robotics Congress, educational robots will program, sing, dance, and paint. The front of the booth is filled with curious children. The cute appearance and various functions are very popular. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, compared with previous years, the reporter noted that the “Innovative Education Lab” debuted at this year's World Robotics Conference and was widely received by the industry and parents. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So what about the innovation education laboratory? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reporter conducted a visit at the exhibition site.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is the future classroom?</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this year's exhibition, a number of companies exhibited their own “Innovative Education Labs”, which have different names, such as “Artificial Intelligence Lab”, “AI Maker Lab”, “Robot Children's College”, etc. All are in "providing comprehensive innovation solutions for AI education." According to the statistics of the reporters, the enterprises involved in the innovation education laboratory among the companies participating in the World Robotics Congress are: Xiaochu Robot, Youbie, Lanyun Eagle, Robot Children's College. , Avatar Robot, Kangli Youlan and Senhan Robot.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhou Wei, director of the Kangliyoulan Education Project Department, believes that the core of educational robots is to let children learn how to get along with machines and use machines to solve their own practical problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Previous educational robots focused on human-computer interaction, and did not exert enough power on the development of engineering thinking, logical thinking and innovative thinking. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The current educational robot can realize modularization of hardware and visual programming on software, and complete robot education learning through intuitive operation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Students explore the problems they encounter in life or study, and boldly imagine working with their teachers to design programs, develop procedures, produce works, and promote their ability to innovate.”</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The “AI Maker Lab” launched by Zhou Wei not only includes intelligent education robots that can realize modularization, but also includes a visual programming software platform, a curriculum material system covering the whole education stage, and the most advanced artificial intelligence carrier equipment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He introduced that after three months of listing, they have helped dozens of schools and educational institutions to have a complete artificial intelligence education base with software and hardware and curriculum content, and also help entrepreneurs who are interested in AI education to achieve one-stop operation. Start a business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, he said, this kind of intelligent laboratory will be priced according to the size of the classroom and the price of the equipment, such as a 70 square meter primary school laboratory, the price ranged from 300,000 to 500,000. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During the interview, a woman from the education industry who came from Chongqing asked about the specific situation of “AI Maker Lab” and expressed strong purchasing interest in this future artificial intelligence education.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How does the innovative education laboratory teach class?</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How can an innovative education laboratory teach specific lessons? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reporter interviewed the manager of the artificial intelligence laboratory of Avatar Robot, Mr. Hou. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Avatar Robot's artificial intelligence project currently has several application cases for kindergartens and primary schools, and has relatively mature experience in the direction of innovative education laboratories. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Manager Hou introduced, “Currently, the kindergarten project mainly uses the understanding robot as the starting point, tells the common sense in life, and pays attention to the application of the function of the robot in the life scene. The elementary school will involve some basic programming subjects, we have a standard set of stem courses. ."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to him, at present, the kindergarten curriculum basically arranges one class per week, about 20 minutes each time, and the course will be arranged according to the difference between the small class and the middle class. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The courses currently applied mainly include three subjects: art class, library and science and development room. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Library subjects mainly teach robots about classic textbooks, including four famous books, etc., with expressions and forms, telling children how to make story kings and telling stories to other children. The department has practical in the course of teaching. Ask the child questions, you can also use the items around you to do some small experiments. The most used in the studio, including paper-cutting, coloring, painting, etc., the robot takes the child step by step, asks the child's completion stage, and uses the robot eyes after finishing the work. Upload a PK comparison with children across the country."</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Innovative education laboratory has broad prospects</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The person in charge of the jimu series project of the excellent robot company introduced to the reporter that robot education allows children to feel the beauty of the machine from a young age and realize the beauty of the law behind it. This is also one of the core of modern stem education. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“The establishment of innovative laboratories allows children to explore and learn in a happy way of learning. The ability to create, innovation, hands-on and analytical skills is greatly enhanced. Educational robots integrate the knowledge and skills of the disciplines, and children often More active and proactive learning, learning related knowledge, truly enjoying the process of creation and hands-on, and learning new knowledge, is the best education for children."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is understood that China has incorporated robot education into the general technical and information technology education content of primary and secondary schools in the "Guidelines for the National Nine-Year Compulsory Education Curriculum Comprehensive Practice Activities". At present, it has already carried out innovative practice in schools in Shanghai and Zhejiang. . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Innovative Education Lab can construct a deep integration platform of “Internet +” education, promote the integration of information technology and education and teaching, and have a wide application space in the future,” said Zhou Wei, director of Kangli Youlan Education Project Department.</font></font></p>
