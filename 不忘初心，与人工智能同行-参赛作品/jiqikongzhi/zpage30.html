          <h1 class="title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artificial intelligence is quietly attacking: it is time to raise a smart sweeping robot.</font></font></h1>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In recent days, Bill Gates’s words are circulating on the Internet: “In the future, a home without a smart home system will be as unpopular as a home that cannot be accessed today. Maybe now we feel fresh technology, just a few years later. It will become very common!" Yes, everyone may think that this statement is too exaggerated, that this life is still far away from us, and even many people dismissed the current artificial intelligence, but completely defeated Ke Jie in AlphaGo. Google’s self-driving cars are on the road, and even when Siri can take you away, people have to admit that artificial intelligence has entered our lives, and its “intelligence” is far more than we think. It is much taller and closer to us than we think.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A little closer to AI - the industry revolution in smart home devices</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The so-called artificial intelligence is actually a branch of computer science. It attempts to understand the essence of human intelligence and produces a new intelligent machine that can respond in a similar way to human intelligence. Research in this field includes robotics and language recognition. , image recognition, natural language processing and expert systems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the birth of artificial intelligence, the theory and technology have become more and more mature, and its application in various fields and fields has become more and more extensive. Even our daily life is inseparable from it.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By scanning and analyzing the three-dimensional structure of the room in real time and automatically formulating the cleaning plan, the electric sweeping robot will automatically charge the cleaning robot; regularly monitor the shelf life of the food in the refrigerator, prompt the expiration information, and automatically generate recipes and help users to formulate the shopping plan. Refrigerator; an air purifier that automatically collects weather changes and pollution conditions to automatically adjust the working mode... These sound like products from the future world, but now they are changing the labs, production workshops and online sales platforms of major domestic power companies. Become a reality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not so much a trend that artificial intelligence has set up in the home industry. It is a trend, and it will eventually usher in an industry revolution in the context of artificial intelligence.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Seeing big and small - the prospect of smart sweeping robot industry is broad</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Smart home equipment may be the most significant effect on our life changes in a short period of time, and it is also the most common impact, don't believe it, even the unremarkable sweeping robot, in the application of AI I became able to hear and speak more intelligently.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./zimg/z291.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Speaking of sweeping robots, it has become very popular and popular in the European and American markets, and the market penetration rate has reached 16%. After all, the big House is really hard to clean. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, in China, people don't catch it. On the one hand, because of the fact that China's family housing is small and there are many things, the sweeping robots “have hit the wall everywhere”. On the other hand, the installation is complicated, the cleaning effect is general and the noise problem is also It can be a headache. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, when the AI ​​boom swept the world, intelligent sweeping robots came into being. It not only solved the past defects to a certain extent, but also the application of artificial intelligence made it really able to play a role in home cleaning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to authoritative statistics, the retail sales of China's sweeping robot market will increase to 12 billion yuan in 2018. This shows that there is a huge space for the development of the sweeping robot industry in the future, and China will surely blossom in this field.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">See the essence through the phenomenon - experience the feeling of AI charm</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the overall view of the current sweeping robot market, the functions of each product can meet the basic needs of users, but the problems of homogenization in appearance and function are also obvious. If there is no core technology and innovation. Change and excellent product quality are easily eliminated by the market. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, although the prospects of the sweeping robot industry are enticing, how to break through the encirclement and truly win the favor of consumers is also a problem worthy of attention and consideration by all manufacturers.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./zimg/z292.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this regard, ILIFE wisdom is at the forefront of the market, but also opened a good start. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Its latest product, the Tianmu X660 intelligent sweeping robot, has become a truly intelligent sweeping robot with its product features of “visible, thinking, fully automatic intelligent cleaning”.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Blinking the world - AI gives the robot the strongest brain</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The biggest feature of this sweeping robot is that it is equipped with a costly US OmniVision HD camera at the top. I think it is necessary to tell everyone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, most of the previous sweeping robots are not equipped with cameras, which means that they can only rely on the support of the algorithm for "blind scanning" when working. First of all, the cleaning effect is first, and the efficiency is very low. Crossing covers as much as possible of all areas to be cleaned, but it is impossible to avoid omissions, and the OmniVision HD camera is a good complement to this defect in the application of this sweeping robot, making it truly "visualized". clean".</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Secondly, OmniVision is second to none in the CMOS industry. As early as the iPhone4 mobile phone, the adoption of OmniVision high-definition camera has made the iPhone 4 the first to provide 4K video shooting experience in the mobile phone industry. It has always been a model in the high-definition camera field. The ILIFE Intelligent Eyes X660 intelligent sweeping robot is also equipped with a high-definition camera, which is also reflected in practical applications, through the visualization function provided by the camera.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, it is not enough to support complex cleaning work. The self-developed Eye-In Space Cruise system can detect stereoscopic sensors for the surrounding environment. The built-in Cortex-A7 quad-core processor, CMOS chip, ARM Cortex- M0+ microprocessor, so that ILIFE Zhiyi Tianmu X660 intelligent sweeping robot has the ability to adapt to the family environment and evolve and evolve its own functions according to the furniture environment, giving it a "strongest brain" with active thinking. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks to the addition of these black technologies, this sweeping robot can provide a complete and autonomous cleaning route solution for environmental detection results. In addition, the CV-SLAM algorithm can help sweeping robots in all directions. Avoid dead ends. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This effective combination of soft and hard has further improved its cleaning efficiency and has taken a solid step in the direction of automation, autonomy and intelligence.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Predicting danger, auto-charging, leaking and filling in the gaps</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, the ILIFE Zhiyi Tianmu X660 intelligent sweeping robot can also predict the "danger". Its built-in infrared light electronic eye can automatically avoid obstacles when encountering obstacles, and can sense the height drop to prevent falling. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before the cleaning is completed, it is also possible to intelligently “check for missing vacancies” according to the route and cleaning plan, and return to the unclean area to continue working. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the battery is in a hurry, you can automatically find the charging stand. After the battery is fully charged, it will return to the position just broken and then clean it. It is very smart.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In recent years, ILIFE has entered the domestic market with wisdom, and under the background of artificial intelligence technology sweeping the world, it has perfectly realized the organic combination of artificial intelligence and home cleaning equipment, and fully integrated the products with the reality of the domestic market. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The ILIFE Zhiyi Tianmu X660 intelligent sweeping robot also allows me to have the convenience, comfort, speed and worry-free personal experience brought by artificial intelligence. It is a smart sweeping robot that truly meets the requirements of home cleaning.</font></font></p>
