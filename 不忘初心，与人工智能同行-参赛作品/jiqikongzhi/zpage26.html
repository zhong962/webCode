          <h1 class="title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first batch of nurse robots were "on the job", they are good helpers for nurses.</font></font></h1>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a model hospital for intelligent nursing in Guangdong Province, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital has carried out a brave attempt to reform the supply side, relying on “Shenzhen Zhizhuang” and “Shenzhen Innovation”, and joining hands with Shenzhen’s local technology innovation enterprises and research institutes to take patients as the center. With demand-oriented, the technology, integration and re-innovation in industrialized laboratories are applied to clinical nursing practice, innovatively explore intelligent nursing, and lead the epoch-making change of nursing work.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this hospital, the first batch of robot nurses have been “on the job”, let us take a look at how these amazing “smart guards” work.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most dexterous "smart guard": dispensing robot "light angel"</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this batch of "in-the-job" "smart care", Shenzhen Bo is the most "smart" of the dispensing robot "lighting angel" developed by Medical Robot Co., Ltd. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the past, the intravenous infusion drugs required by patients relied on the manual configuration of nursing staff, which not only prone to human error and pollution, but also pose a potential threat to patient safety, and high-risk drugs such as chemotherapy drugs also have high occupational injuries during the dispensing process. risk.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The ampoule is cut, cut off, the vial is opened, disinfected, shaken, pumped, infused... In the 100-level closed environment, the "lighting angel" uses its flexible manipulator to "satisfied" to operate a complex match. Liquid program. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the verification of the prescription to the preparation of the medicine, the medicine, and a bottle of chemotherapeutic medicine mixed with 6 medicines, the whole process takes less than 8 minutes.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Lighting Angel" will not only open the vial, but also open the glass ampoule. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You should know that the types and specifications of ampoules are very different, and they are very easy to smash. Foreign robots cannot be opened. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Through high-tech such as visual recognition system, "Lighting Angel" can identify 95% of clinical drugs, not only can be accurately opened, the damage rate is less than one ten thousandth, and the residual rate of drugs is less than 3.5%.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will also classify the class. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During the dispensing process, the needle and the ampoules are placed in the sharp box and placed in the sharp box. The blunt instruments such as syringes and vials are placed in the garbage bag, which fully complies with the medical waste disposal regulations and avoids the nurses' separation process. Risk of injury.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most diligent "smart guard": nursing robot "Emma"</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among the first “on-the-job” robots, Bo’s other pair of “sister flowers” ​​– “Emma” is the most diligent robot.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Sister" is a nurse assistant robot, serving in the inpatient ward. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Help patients to go through admission procedures, familiar with the hospital environment, hospitalizations, print hospitalization lists, and more. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The patient has something unclear to find it, it is "not annoying", "temper" is super good. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It also often helps nurses “run the legs”: the nurse simply puts the delivered items into its storage compartment, enters the bed number and other information, and it “runs” to the patient's bed to “deliver”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The patient swipes the bar code on the wristband and automatically unlocks the “receipt” on the “dark number”.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Sister" is a medical logistics robot that works in the operating room. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The surgically used dirt, the nurse placed on the dirt corridor shelf, as soon as the button is pressed, it will immediately be taken away and sent to the disinfection center. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On call, not afraid of dirty and not tired.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Autonomous navigation, autonomous obstacle avoidance, human-computer interaction, autonomous charging... The intelligence of these "sisters" is very high.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most worry-free "smart care": intelligent infusion monitor</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the past, the infusion, patients and family members are always worried about the drop, the nurse did not know, especially at night, did not dare to sleep. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Peking University Shenzhen Hospital has teamed up with the intelligent infusion monitor independently developed by Shenzhen Lianxin Mobile Medical Technology Co., Ltd., which has solved this problem.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This intelligent infusion monitor is very compact and hangs on the patient's infusion stand. Based on the microgravity sensor and a number of patented technologies and patented algorithms, it can accurately monitor the remaining fluid volume of the infusion and transmit the data to the care background via Bluetooth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The nurse can remotely view the drop rate and residual volume of the patient's infusion at the nurse station via a large screen, computer, or NDA. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is still a few minutes to pick up the bottle and pull the needle. If there is any abnormality in the infusion, the system will have a smart reminder.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"With this system, when the medicine is dispensed, bottled, and needled, the nurses have a lot of thoughts, and the work is planned and improves the efficiency." Zhou Tao, head nurse of the oral and maxillofacial microsurgery area of ​​Peking University Shenzhen Hospital Say.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most attentive "smart care": wearable devices</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wearable devices are the current hot health care industry and an emerging technology industry supported by Shenzhen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the intelligent ward of Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, the reporter saw that a number of wearable devices of “Lianxin” were used in clinical practice.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A small sheet of ECG sensor, a pulse oximeter clamped on the finger, a flexible thermometer attached to the armpit, and a wireless infrared ear thermometer. These portable wearable devices achieve body temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen, pulse, etc. Wireless intelligent collection of vital signs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These continuously collected information, through the analysis of big data, can also generate various charts, automatically alert for abnormalities, and timely assist in the decision-making of care.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Patients with inconvenience such as senile diseases and severe diseases are most afraid of acne, and it is particularly important to turn over in time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes family members forget to turn over, nurses do not know, this work will inevitably not be in place. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A small table-sized contactless smart monitor solves this problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just put it under the mattress and when it doesn't turn over, it will prompt on the nurse's handheld terminal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It also has a fall-proof function, and if the patient accidentally falls from the bed, it will automatically alarm.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most witty "smart guard": "health security guards"</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Health Care Guardian” is an emergency wearable device embedded in a badge. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the emergency department, patients who need to be rescued, the first medical staff who can be treated can "one-click call", and the rescue team will immediately reinforce according to the positioning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the event of a violent assault, you can also "one-click alarm", and the nearest security and medical colleagues can quickly arrive to protect the medical staff.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most alert "smart guard": a smart wristband that will alarm</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The aortic dissection is a "time bomb" in the patient's body. Once it breaks, the hope of rushing to survive is extremely low. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such patients are often asked by doctors and nurses to rest in bed and reduce the amount of activity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But when there are no symptoms, patients tend to feel good about themselves, and even more "naughty" patients even sneak out of the ward, which has great security risks.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital puts a smart wristband with identification and positioning function for the patient. As long as the patient does not follow the doctor's advice and takes out the restricted area, the system will alarm. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Medical staff can promptly persuade these "naughty ghosts" to ensure the safety of patients.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most intriguing "intelligence": "Digital Little Nurse"</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the traditional nursing work, the nurse has to check seven pairs of three pairs, to write complicated nursing documents, and to patrol in the sick rooms constantly... In the reality of the shortage of nurses, it is necessary to cope with these heavy routines. The transactional work, the nurses are exhausted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The physical exertion does not say that you have to tighten a string, for fear of mistakes.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the intelligent nursing ward of Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, the two-dimensional wristbands identified by the hospitalized patients and the handheld mobile terminal NDA carried by each nurse have realized the intelligence of “three checks and seven pairs”. "Zero error" guarantees medical safety.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And based on the big data of intelligent nursing, the newly developed “Digital Little Nurse” (Intelligent Care Decision System) is a good helper for the director of the nursing department. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It integrates ward clinical care and nursing management big data in real time, and can provide intelligent assistant decision-making for nursing management personnel in clinical, human resources, risk, quality and training, which is conducive to closed-loop management and continuous improvement of nursing quality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Taking risk management as an example, “Digital Little Nurse” can summarize the number of occurrences of various adverse events, automatically compare with the data of the same period last year, draw a trend graph of adverse events, and analyze the causes of various adverse events from multiple angles. Precise interventions.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most interactive "smart care": follow-up APP allows care to continue after discharge</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The intelligent nursing is not only in the hospital, but also continues to the post-discharge. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, the nurses completed a mobile office service such as online follow-up, disease statistics, and satisfaction survey for oral cancer patients through a handheld oral follow-up APP. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The patient also uses the APP to leave a message online, interacts with the medical staff online, and improves the ability of self-prevention and care through a healthy classroom.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reporter learned that these nursing apps are also used in many fields such as peritoneal dialysis and pregnancy management. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In obstetrics and gynaecology, pregnant mothers can make an appointment for B-ultrasound and other check-ups through the APP, and check the knowledge and guidance during pregnancy.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Robots replace nurses? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No, it is just a good "helper" for nurses.</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not complain, do not shout tired, do not complain, 24 hours on duty, accurate and safe. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In other words, the industrious and intelligent "intelligence and care" will do all the trivial things of injection, medicine, body temperature, and ward ward. Can the nurses still do it?</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Zhi Xiao Hu” liberates the nurse from simple and mechanical repetitive labor, which is to let the nurse return to the patient's side, and have more abundant time to provide more professional services such as psychological counseling, life care and health guidance. Improve the labor value of nurses, reduce the sense of burnout, and improve the relationship between doctors and patients. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is also the core and purpose of intelligent nursing reform.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The market for service robots is already erupting. I heard that there are more "smart guards" on the road...</font></font></p>
