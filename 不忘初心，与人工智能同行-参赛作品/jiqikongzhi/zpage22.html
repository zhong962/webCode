            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the 2018 CES World Consumer Electronics Show, there are many black technology gatherings, and there are many new generations of robot products. One of Aeolus's home service robots has recently made a splash. It can not only be used as a family babysitter, dry wipe. The floor cleaning furniture is dirty and tired, and you can also get back the needed drinks in the refrigerator according to your needs.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In an interview with the foreign media Washington Post, Alexander Huang, a researcher at Aeolus Robotics, said that the robot is mainly targeted at the daily routine of the family. It can learn about the surrounding environment and the owner who lives at home for a long time. By understanding the owner's personalized needs and hobby to provide personal services, he also said: "Now it is still in a child stage, our development is continuing, and soon we can turn it from a child to a real Knowing the user's adult robot, the more users use it, the more powerful it will be."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is worth mentioning that Aeolus Robotics' CTO chief technology officer is also one of the R&amp;D members of IBM's Watson robot project. Therefore, the research strength behind this company is still very strong. One of the key functions of machine learning is It can identify thousands of different objects and accurately locate the position of each object. It can be accurately returned to the original place after being taken out. Even if the child's teddy bear is thrown away, these Aeolus robots can also They are neatly packed, and their robotic arm can accurately pick up the required items. After connecting with the Internet of Things of smart homes such as Google Home and Amazon Alexa, it can also be updated in real time to improve their work ability.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, the robot's memory function can help users find forgotten items, Huang said: "This is the world's first multi-function robot to simulate human activities, you can tell it to make it after cleaning the room. Re-arranged as it is.” Aeolus's robot is a good helper for housework, and it can also help care for the elderly at home and those with limited mobility. Through gesture recognition, it can accurately identify if someone is at home. Falling or need emergency assistance so that it can help others find help or make an emergency call.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of appearance, the size and weight of this robot is similar to that of a 12-year-old child, but Aeolus has not given the robot a specific name. They say: "We still need some time to bring the latest robot technology, AI artificial intelligence. Combined with machine learning technology and trying to reduce the cost of its research and development, it will take some time before the final robot product appears, but it doesn't take too long, it may be launched as early as this year."</font></font></p>
