          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Want to pick fresh lychee in the orchard and eat the weather is too hot? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After picking the lychee, you don't have to do it yourself! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the matchmaking meeting of modern agricultural science and technology innovation achievements in Guangdong Province, exhibitors showed a smart fruit picking robot. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This kind of robot can be used by two people, "one person", and has been "rearing" in some fruit cooperatives in Guangdong to carry out non-destructive picking operations on melon and fruit products. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the docking meeting, the “high-top” technology of agriculture emerged endlessly, attracting more than 500 leading agricultural enterprises to “treasure hunt”.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The person in charge of the relevant team of South China Agricultural University who developed the intelligent picking robot told the reporter that the most prominent strength of this robot is that it has the same eye-catching effect as Astro Boy. It can use binocular stereo vision to locate the fruit in the orchard and obtain the vision. Multiple random fruit targets are included, and then the mathematical planning method is used to independently plan the picking operation path, and finally the anthropomorphic finger at the end of the robot arm is extended to pick the fruit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will not be very rude when picking the fruit, first clamp the fruit branches with the fingers, and then cut the fruit branches by cutting. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because the end of the actuator has a certain versatility, it can work on a variety of fruits, including lychee, citrus, cucumber and so on.</font></font></p>

          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the development team, in terms of work efficiency, the robot can pick up 40 pounds of lychee per hour, which is twice the number of people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the work site has completed the hard-bottom construction and there is a flat cement road everywhere, the robot plus the AGV car can move freely, and in some rugged gardens, it is still necessary to use a small push truck to work.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deep-water hydroponic hydroponic vegetables do not need to fight</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reporter learned from the Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences that the docking event has set up 33 booths and 16 special docking booths, displaying as many as 1,000 scientific and technological achievements patents and products, from the latest cultivation techniques to biological genetic achievements. The agricultural “Internet” to food processing is mostly the latest scientific research achievements in the agricultural field of Guangdong, and many of them have won the national or provincial science and technology awards.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reporter found a deep-water fluid hydroponic technique in the booth. Unlike the general soilless culture, this technology uses more nutrient solution, and the vegetable roots grow more space. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to Shi Liangliang, deputy director of the Research Office of the Agricultural Research and Experiment Demonstration Field of the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the deep-water hydroponic culture can receive 10~11 一年 a year, even when the common leafy vegetables are not connected, it can be listed without any pesticide. Let's take lettuce as an example. If you produce 4,000 pounds per mu, you can get around 40,000 pounds a year. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“This kind of dish is more used for salad production, and there are more Western foods.” Shi Liangliang said that the price of lettuce is 5~6 yuan per catty. Some people also think that soilless vegetables are relatively clean, using a crystal. The ball covers it and sells it as an ornamental vegetable. A dish can be sold for 10 yuan.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, the reporter saw that many merchants were consulting before the booths of rice aromatherapy technology, 3D printing furniture technology for forest waste materials, and the cooperation between Tongcai and the stingray fish pond.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Agricultural scientific and technological achievements drive farmers to get rich</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In recent years, Guangdong has set up a provincial agricultural science and technology innovation alliance, promoted the agricultural research results project library and the transformation of agricultural science and technology achievements into a public service platform, and created a “one chess game” agricultural science and technology innovation pattern and a “one chain” agricultural science and technology organization model. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Efforts were made to cultivate leading agricultural enterprises, and by 2015, 3,324 agricultural leading enterprises were successfully cultivated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Leading agricultural enterprises give full play to their advantages, integrate and utilize modern agricultural production factors, and continue to develop into the leader of agricultural transformation and upgrading, the transformation and absorption of agricultural scientific and technological achievements, and the carriers of income increase.</font></font></p>
