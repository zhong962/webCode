          <h1 class="title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People's Daily Decodes Face Recognition Technology: Baidu and other companies let "brush face" enter you and my life</font></font></h1>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anyone familiar with the history of science and technology knows that the initial application scenarios of any revolutionary technology, including computers, the Internet and smart phones, basically occurred in specific fields such as military industry, government and medical care, and then evolved into the public after the technology matured. Products - but I don't know if you are aware. In recent years, thanks to deep learning algorithms and big data, the rapid evolution of technology maturity has made the process of transforming many AI technologies to the public very short, such as face recognition.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s1031.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A recent article in the People’s Daily pointed out: “Now, from attendance, shopping, to flying, staying at a hotel, and even adopting a pension, it’s no longer a joke to eat by face.... Face recognition is going out of the experiment on a large scale. The room has entered all walks of life, which has facilitated life, reduced costs and improved efficiency, and has gradually become a 'standard' in people's daily lives."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, this is not difficult to understand. For face recognition, a new technology species closely related to security, how popular is the popularity, which depends largely on how familiar the application scenario is, and just like the popularity of fingerprint recognition in the past. In the same process, benefiting from the good market education work of mobile phone manufacturers such as Apple, in a very short time, face recognition is a more rapid, safe, and even cooler way of recognition, which has been highly recognized by the public. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Face recognition is now taken for granted, both in the public and personal worlds.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, what does not match this popular cognition is that the strong chasing identity of the industrial age has caused many people to ignore one point: in the field of face recognition, China has actually entered the first echelon.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recently, the international authoritative market insight report Gen Market Insights released the "Global Face Recognition Equipment Market Research Report" said: China's face recognition production value in 2017 accounted for 29.29% of the world's market share, and will reach 44.59% in 2023. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The data from Ai Media Consulting also shows that the size of China's computer vision market in 2017 is 6.8 billion yuan. It is estimated that the market size will reach 78 billion yuan in 2020, with an average annual compound growth rate of 125.5%.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More importantly, China’s protagonist on the face recognition track is not only reflected in market share (you can of course say it is part of the demographic dividend), but also the technology itself: Chinese companies like Baidu have relied on The face detection deep learning algorithm PyramidBox, in the world's authoritative face detection public evaluation set WIDER FACE's "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard" three evaluation subsets have won the top spot, refreshing the industry's best results; not only that, Looking through the scientific and technological information about face recognition, you can often see Chinese companies in the international rankings of different latitudes and different metrics.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People can't help but ask, how did all this happen?</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The answer is actually very simple. China's position in face recognition – and the entire echelon of artificial intelligence – stems from the continued technological investment of Chinese technology companies and the rich ability to spread the scene.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The next scene of identification</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's take a brief look at this technology.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, since human beings have stepped into information civilization and started to get in touch with machines, they have become aware of the importance of identity recognition and invented various methods of identity authentication. Until now, no one will deny the next scene of identity recognition. It will be replaced by biometrics. Among them, face recognition will be the first biometric technology to be landed on a large scale due to comprehensive reasons such as technology maturity and cost.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And because of this, many people underestimate the difficulty of this technology, in fact, for the "other" (whether AI or possible alien civilization), the human face structure has a very high similarity, we feel It is not difficult (face blindness or even a disease) because the brain has evolved a powerful face recognition ability millions of years ago, and the nervous system process involved is very complicated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the end of last year, the internationally renowned journal Cell showed a specific neuron process of face recognition: in the process of recognition, the brain can recognize some key dimensions, and recognizing a face requires dozens of dimensions, each "face cell" Approximately several parameters of six dimensions are encoded, and finally a combination of parameters of different features of a face is integrated.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s1032.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This means that for the machine, face recognition is not easy, and the instinctive reaction between human beings must be transformed into a real data analysis process—fortunately, through the unremitting efforts of the industry, the results are satisfactory, with Baidu For example, similar to the human brain recognition process, the face recognition technology can recognize multiple face attributes (such as gender, age, expression, etc.) according to the 72 feature points of the face and face, and combine them into a complete facial expression network. Identify each person's expressions and appearance features, and then perform one-to-many face retrieval with the existing face database, and finally apply to various scenes such as identification and verification.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A true portrayal of Chinese AI</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, the implementation path of AI general technology is similar (similar to data as fuel, algorithm as engine), as a branch of machine vision, although face recognition has certain uniqueness, but it is only a portrayal of China's artificial intelligence technology capabilities.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not long ago, the China Artificial Intelligence Development Report 2018 published by the China Science and Technology Policy Research Center of Tsinghua University showed that China has become the country with the largest number of artificial intelligence patents in the world, with the number leading the United States and Japan.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This may be a little unexpected for the public, but it is the consensus of the industry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the past year or two, including the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, many foreign media and analysts have pointed out that the huge amount of data, the growing talent pool, and the top-level support of government departments are cultivating China. Develop the most fertile soil for AI.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is not difficult to understand that the AI ​​revolution that is erupting directly benefits from the data bonus of the surge and the establishment of standards for deep learning algorithms. The integration of the two has completely smoothed the technological starting line of the new era (such as ten years ago, Image recognition and speech recognition may be different algorithms, but deep learning will open up the underlying logic, which in essence becomes an algorithm, and the software technology accumulated by many companies is directly invalidated, giving China a good opportunity to overtake the curve.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, when the technology turns to come, the one who really catches it must be a prepared and capable person. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is gratifying is that in dealing with artificial intelligence, Chinese companies not only start early, but also invest heavily in technology. For example, as one of the earliest companies in the world to deploy artificial intelligence, Baidu invests 15% of its annual revenue for AI research and development. Nowadays, it has supported the hundreds of billions of parameters, the super-large neural network of 100 billion samples and feature training, and the "feeding" of trillions of training data, which constantly promotes the iteration of algorithms and computational powers, and is also benefiting from this, now Baidu AI The Technology Platform System (AIG) has a comprehensive technology of voice, image, natural language processing, video, knowledge map, etc., and has laid a foundation for development in deep learning frameworks and AI chips.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, in addition to the technology itself, the operators of those technologies - a large number of artificial intelligence talents - are also the most valuable resources of the Chinese AI industry. As Luo Zhenyu said in his speech last year, China graduates millions of engineers every year. Any other country can do this.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the importance of talent is often overlooked. It is not difficult to find out at the beginning of the mobile Internet. At the beginning of the platform-level technology, many seemingly unsolvable problems are essentially because there are too few people in this industry. You know, only when there are enough engineers in the Android ecosystem to build a prosperous mobile Internet ecosystem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same is true for artificial intelligence. As the leading edge of Chinese companies becomes more prominent, their talent attraction will increase. This is undoubtedly a huge advantage, and it is also the key for China to lead the first echelon in the artificial intelligence industry.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China's artificial intelligence, which occupies the "time, place, and people", has begun to form a benign development of ecology. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The exciting thing is that in the era of artificial intelligence, Chinese companies did not choose to build high-tech barriers, but chose the open road. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Baidu, which has first-mover advantage in artificial intelligence, announced its open strategy in 2017, opening up more than 110 global leading AI capabilities and software and hardware components for developers and enterprises, and “hands-on” to teach developers to use AI. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, under the leadership of Baidu, Tencent, Ali, Jingdong, Shangtang and other companies have also launched AI open plans. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">China's artificial intelligence has formed a "potential of the original."</font></font></p>

            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rooting</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And when artificial intelligence has gradually become the infrastructure of the new era, the ultimate goal of technology leadership is certainly not to show off the skills, but to take root in more fields and bear fruit.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fortunately, compared with developed countries, China may be the most active country to embrace digital transformation. The demand for transformation and upgrading of traditional enterprises with artificial intelligence is more urgent, and the market growth momentum is more sufficient. At the same time, Chinese AI enterprises We are also constantly exploring more diverse application scenarios.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As far as face recognition is concerned, China is at the forefront in terms of landing, as the People’s Daily summarized in the article:</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of security, face recognition can monitor crowds of airports and shopping malls to achieve automatic identification and tracking of specific people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the beginning of this year, many places, such as Shenzhen, have begun to implement electronic police enforcement. By “painting the face”, it is illegal to identify pedestrians and non-motor vehicles, which has greatly improved the efficiency of social operations.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the financial aspect, as you know, the face payment is familiar, and gradually penetrates into the core of the financial industry such as pre-lending review and identity verification, and the bank can quickly check the identification information. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, face recognition has been applied by Baidu Finance to cooperation projects with Taikang Insurance and Agricultural Bank of China.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of retail, the perfection of face recognition technology makes it possible for unmanned supermarkets. In the shopping and settlement process, face recognition can help offline stores quickly capture user information to provide personalized services.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of travel, Baidu and China Southern Airlines' face recognition-based "brush face" boarding project has also landed at Jiangying Airport in Nanyang, Henan, and the face gate can complete identity verification in seconds. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, in Wuzhen and Wuyishan and other scenic spots, face recognition can also enhance the tourist experience while improving the efficiency of the scenic spot.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, these are just the changes that are taking place. In more areas that need to be explored, Baidu also provides face detection algorithms and face recognition solutions to developers through the AI ​​open platform, enabling face recognition to take root in more fields. germination. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, as mentioned earlier, face recognition is only one example of China's artificial intelligence technology capabilities, which means that when the AI ​​is fully landed, the fruit is not only one of the face recognition.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, whether it is a giant or a startup, with the continuous breakthrough of Chinese AI companies in speech recognition, natural language processing and image recognition, the pace of artificial intelligence from the laboratory to the market far exceeds many people's imagination. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, Baidu has continued to graft with other industries, making AI like a capillary, infiltrating into software tools, transportation, security, education, smart equipment, life services and logistics, bringing profound industrial changes.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conclusion</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even today, even the most pessimistic skeptics can hardly deny that artificial intelligence is the most important variable in current human society, and its fourth industrial revolution is changing the way of human production and production. The path of development of the revolution is very similar - just like the outbreak of the "electrical" species in the electrical revolution of the mid-19th century, and the possibility of mass production, the moment you and I are in the artificial intelligence to spread to different scenes. At the critical stage, the social impact it produces is difficult to estimate.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like many people, I also believe that when more Chinese companies seize the opportunity of history and miss the previous industrial revolution and therefore lag behind, China will usher in the dawn of artificial intelligence.</font></font></p>
