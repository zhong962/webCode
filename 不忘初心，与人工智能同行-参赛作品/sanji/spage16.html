            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How does multimodal depth semantic understanding be implemented technically? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How much energy do you have? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How will it be applied to change our lives? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the Baidu Brain Forum on the afternoon of the same day, the core technology of Baidu Brain 3.0 “shows” one by one, bringing a technical feast to developers.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The venue for 1,000 people was packed, the developers even sat on the ground, or stood at the venue and finally listened to the full field. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One developer said, “There are too many dry goods and too little time. Go back and look for the playback video to digest it.”</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From "seeing clearly and clearing" to "understanding and understanding"</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Multi-modal depth semantic understanding enables the machine to understand and understand clearly, to better understand the meaning behind it, to deeply understand the real world, and to better support various applications."
