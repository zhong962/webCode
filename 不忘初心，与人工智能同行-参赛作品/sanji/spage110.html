          <h1 class="title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dialects can also recognize the smart home into the human-computer interaction stage.</font></font></h1>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the hot film "Super Marines", the robot protagonist "Big White" can recognize other people's words and answer them "tactly". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the two technologies of speech recognition and artificial intelligence are perfected to a certain extent, it is possible to obtain the temperature of human interaction from the cold machine.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s1091.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This kind of "human-computer interaction" that exists only in animation or science fiction films is expected to enter the homes of ordinary people this year. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yesterday, Keda Xunfei, the earliest in China to enter the field of speech recognition, announced that it has teamed up with Jingdong to assist the latter in technology research and development, and to integrate speech recognition into intelligent hardware.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After a long time, you can use Mandarin or even dialect to switch your home appliances and get rid of the shackles of mobile phones, watches and other intermediate terminals.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dialect can also recognize speech</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During the Spring Festival, many people have seen a video: a Shandong big brother wants to use the car voice to make a phone call, tried four or five times without success, but was "despised" by the machine, making a joke.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Liu Zongqi, founder of Hangzhou Gubei Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. also watched this video. "There are problems in speech recognition technology, especially for more complicated Chinese." Since last year, he and the team have contacted no less than five in China for speech recognition. The team hopes to integrate their technology into their own smart hardware.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to the University of Science and Technology, there are still many teams doing speech recognition in China, such as Baidu Voice and Si Bi Chi. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After contacting these teams, Liu Zongxi believes that the recognition rate of each family is not much different, and the recognition rate for simple instructions is not bad. "Already use smart hardware."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not long ago, he tried Amazon's latest smart home assistant Echo, and it was almost entirely wrong with voice commands. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is even more rare is that this machine supports far-field voice control, and commands can be sent 7-8 meters away from the machine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to Amazon's idea, when users want to buy things in the near future, they will directly tell this small machine to help them place orders.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Compared with English, Chinese is not only semantically complicated, but also has great differences in local dialects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For a long time, HKUST has tried to identify dialects. At present, the recognition of Cantonese, Sichuan dialect and Henan dialect has been completed, but the recognition rate and stability have yet to be improved.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even so, there have been more and more cases of using speech recognition technology on smart hardware. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before the cooperation between Spirit and Xiaozhi Audio, the voice wake-up was realized in the air, and the user could directly search for the song by voice without pressing the button.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Smart home and human interaction upgrade</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Spirent CEO Gao Shixing believes that all small screen or no-screen smart hardware has voice control requirements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This also determines the market prospects for future speech recognition technology. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first step is to realize the networking of the device, the second step is to realize the linkage between the device and the device, and the third step is the interaction of the human-machine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the three stages of development of smart home in Liu Zongxi's eyes. Many teams at home and abroad have completed the first two steps of research and development and promotion, and the next step is the third step.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"From the user's point of view, it is definitely the simpler and more direct use." In his view, the best state of people and machines is to interact like people and people. Currently, using mobile phones or tablets to control home appliances is the most primitive. State, "If voice recognition can completely free users from the shackles, smart homes will soon become popular."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He also regarded the marriage between Keda Xunfei and Jingdong as a "wind vane" incident. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Previously, the integration in the smart home industry occurred more in hardware companies, and now it has gradually developed to the level of technology and services, and large Internet companies have also entered the platform.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the cooperation agreement between Keda Xunfei and Jingdong, Keda Xunfei mainly produces technology, and Jingdong is responsible for producing products. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, Jingdong has built a JD+ smart home platform, which means that some mature technologies will be applied to the smart hardware products that join the platform in the future.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also in the platform to build is Xiaomi. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Through a series of investments and acquisitions, Xiaomi Chain's smart products have formed a smart ecosystem including air purifiers, bracelets, HD cameras, iHealth smart blood pressure monitors and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lei Jun revealed that Xiaomi has successively invested in 25 eco-chain enterprises.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Last year, Apple released the iHome smart home platform, which has so far acquired 24 smart home businesses. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the beginning of this year, Liu Zongxi visited the Apple Smart Home team in Silicon Valley. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From what he knows, Apple will have an action right away. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gubei’s own “artificial intelligence” products will also be available in the first half of the year.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Small teams and traditional companies have opportunities</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Large companies provide platforms and small companies provide products. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the process of smart home fission, many companies in the industry chain have opportunities.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hangzhou Hezhi Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., which joined the smart home army in 2013, currently has two products, smart socket and smoke alarm. The latter can not only monitor household smoke, natural gas and carbon monoxide, but also remote alarm, price and ordinary smoke. The same as the alarm.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhou Peiliang, the company's director, believes that the development of the Internet has given them these small and medium-sized teams the opportunity to enter the smart home market. For example, the crowdfunding model has allowed their outlets to accumulate thousands of "fever" users. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to plan, they will launch 4-5 products this year, involving hot areas such as security. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhou Peiliang judged that there will be a million smart home products on the market this year, completely igniting the entire market.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More than wanting to miss this feast is the traditional home appliance company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since its establishment, Zhou Peiliang has received many olive branches that have been acquired or invested, mostly from traditional home appliance companies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"We will release the smart home strategy next week, showing the company's vision and layout in the smart home field, which will also be the focus of Hongyan's future development." A senior executive of Hongyan Electric revealed.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the upcoming Shanghai International Lighting Exhibition, Hongyan Electric will be divided into multiple experience zones to facilitate users to experience smart home products. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Taking the living room experience area as an example, the luminaire can be used not only as a remote control, but also as an “environmental inspection guardian” and even as a “big manager” of various household appliances.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The product, called "Elemental Lights", is a crazy concept that their designers use their spare time to brainstorm. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then, the engineers of the company's lighting research institute agreed on the feasibility of the product, and then prototyped.</font></font></p>
