            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Is the vaccine a good business or a life-oriented conscience?</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A few days ago, the longevity biological vaccine case triggered a new round of torture. Two Weibo big V Xie Na and Zhang Ziyi sent questions on Weibo as a mother. The incident began to enter the second fermentation. "How can a problem vaccine occur? How can this be?" A few years ago, the shadow of the "toxic vaccine" in Shandong was not completely gone. A few years later, the issue of vaccine fraud was re-enacted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How can we really do something practical for the vaccine industry?</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From cancer vaccines to individualized cancer vaccines</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In June 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee passed a proposal to allow Merck's cervical cancer vaccine to be marketed, marking a new phase in the human anti-cancer war.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Open Baidu search for the word "cancer vaccine". The news we have seen is basically flaunting the magical effect of cancer vaccine, "a major success in cancer vaccine", "100% destruction of cancerous cells", "the cure rate is as high as 97%" Headlines like this abound. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, this is not the case. The traditional “cancer vaccine” has gone through more than half a century of efforts from early concepts to current clinical trials. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the clinical trial results of cancer vaccines are still not satisfactory compared with other immunotherapy methods.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A major bottleneck faced by researchers is that many cancer cell mutations are "patient-specific", which means that mutations in patients with A may not reappear in patients with B at all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, the vaccines developed only for the "common mutations" of cancer cells are often unsatisfactory. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The concept of precision medicine has not been discussed for one day or two, and immunotherapy is one of the most important means of preventing diseases in humans. Imagine if you can combine the two to develop an individualized cancer vaccine, which will not greatly improve the cancer vaccine. Effect?</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Currently, based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology in the laboratory, scientists have been able to understand the specific mutations in mice, and the new epitopes (the sites where antigens and antibodies bind) produced by these mutations can basically be CD4 and helper T cells (a type of immune cell) are recognized. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The experimental results show that in the mouse model, the vaccine developed for these new epitopes has been shown to be effective in controlling advanced tumors in mice.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What does AI have to enter and individualized cancer vaccines?</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Successful trials in mice have sparked a wave of biotech companies' interest in cancer vaccines. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the process from the laboratory to the clinic is quite long. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, from mouse to human, what is the need to cross the vaccine?</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mutations in human cancer tumor cells are too complex</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to find the mutation part of cancer cells? It is proposed to use gene sequencing method to comprehensively determine the gene spectrum of cancer cells, and then compare the gene spectrum of cancer cells with the gene spectrum of normal cells to identify the mutation part. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although this approach sounds feasible, the actual operation is not the same thing.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is mainly because the cancer tumor itself is a genetic disease, and the genes of the tumor cells are constantly mutated. Therefore, the genomes measured in different periods are different, so it is difficult to obtain an accurate number of cell mutations; Even if we can accurately find the mutation, we can't know which of the hundreds of mutations can activate the immune cells to secrete antibodies, thereby inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The complexity of mutations in cancer tumor cells has reached the point where humans cannot solve them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So if we want to know which mutations can be used to make a vaccine, maybe machine algorithms can come in handy.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, AI predictive death, AI predictive breast cancer and other predictive algorithms are constantly appearing, and the accuracy has been developing in an increasingly higher direction. Whether the prediction algorithm can be applied to the development of cancer vaccines becomes the key to solving the problem.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Parker Cancer Immunotherapy Institute in the United States and the New York City Cancer Institute introduced machine algorithms and planned a computer program competition to explore how many of the cancerous signals in cancer patients are likely to develop in the future. Become a key factor in triggering the immune system to attack tumor cells.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, according to relevant experts, the accuracy of this set of prediction algorithms will not exceed 40%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The rules for algorithm prediction in the industry are not known enough now, and given the "black box" problem of machine learning, no one is qualified to ensure that the final development of the prediction algorithm can be universal.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Production of cancer vaccines is difficult to land easily</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, according to Deloitte's data, the cost of successfully listing a new drug in 2017 has increased to $2 billion. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the profit period of the drug companies is usually only 6-10 years. During the profit period, the drug companies must make enough profits, otherwise the subsequent research and development will be difficult to sustain. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So naturally, when the individualized cancer vaccine becomes a reality, the public must pay for its high price.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2008, Wyeth's 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was launched in China. The total cost of four needles was 3,400 yuan. The price was very expensive at the time, but many parents are still willing to pay for the child's health. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The difference between mass production and custom production I think everyone understands.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the past, the vaccines we used were all in volume production, and everyone got the same vaccine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, if individualized cancer vaccines come in the future, everyone will enjoy customized vaccine services, each vaccine will be different, and the resulting price difference can be imagined.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, it is a problem of the manufacturing cycle. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To achieve individualized cancer vaccine services, medical institutions must conduct accurate vaccine production on a case-by-case basis. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, patients must experience a long waiting time from the discovery of cell mutation to the use of the vaccine.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the data obtained from current clinical trials, no matter which vaccine type (including peptide, RNA, DNA plasmid, etc.), from the discovery of mutation to vaccine development to the clinical application of vaccine, this process takes 3 to 4 months. time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The researchers said they expect to shorten this time to one month in the future. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, compared with coming to the hospital to be able to immediately vaccinate, this time is still quite a long time.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is impossible for individualized cancer vaccines to be included in medical insurance for a short period of time.</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The full name of medical insurance is called basic medical insurance, but everyone often only pays attention to the word "medical insurance" but forgets that "basic" is in the front. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, this means that high-end medical-related expenses are not reimbursed in principle. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So back to the cancer vaccine, isn't the individualized cancer vaccine a high-end medical treatment?</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yang Suying, an analyst of intelligent relativity, believes that "calculation." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At least in the short term. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, individualized cancer vaccines use high-end technologies such as AI technology and cutting-edge biotechnology. Second, precision vaccine production is a high-end service. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, although many anticancer drugs in China have entered the scope of medical insurance, the current research and development of new anticancer drugs is fast, new drugs are listed, and there are still a lot of drugs waiting in line for medical insurance, so even if individualized vaccines are developed, the medical insurance It will take a long time to enter.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why is it so difficult for high-end drugs to enter medical insurance? It is still due to the fact that China still does not have sufficient price control ability in high-end drugs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only those countries that have their own high-end drug research and development level have the ability to enter the country's anti-cancer drugs into health care, such as the United States, Switzerland, Japan and so on.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the other hand, at present, there is only one pharmaceutical company in China that has entered the top 500, and it is still mainly manufacturing low-end drugs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, this has created a very realistic situation. When there is no high-end medicine of the same type in China, it can naturally lose the capital of the price. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If it is necessary to force a new high-end drug, such as the possible emergence of individualized cancer vaccines in the future, the residents' monthly salary may not be able to afford the cost of paying for medical insurance.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vaccination Saas platform: don't want the next melamine</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The technical level is very simple, but the problems other than the technology are complicated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The safety of vaccine circulation and vaccination has not been effectively managed and controlled. In particular, the frequent occurrence of vaccine safety incidents caused by human management factors directly plagues the public about the safety of vaccination. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In particular, the excessive consumption of public trust will eventually lead to the company falling into the “Tasito trap”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then, even if the company sincerely takes out the real thing, it will be like the shadow that Sanlu made to the public many years ago. At that time, the public will not choose to believe.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The public is particularly sensitive to the vaccine incident, and a wave of turmoil can set off a wave of accountability, not to mention the big thing like batch fraud. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to resolve the crisis of trust between the public and the public health industry?</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps in the future, we may try to establish a vaccination Saas platform, plan a vaccination system, and open communication barriers between the B and C terminals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such a Saas platform can achieve all-weather, full-sample, full-data automatic intelligent monitoring and verification, breaking the shortcomings of previous sampling review.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, a series of data is connected to the mobile terminal to realize the traceability of the vaccine from the vaccine manufacturer, the vaccination clinic, to the specific vaccination to the person, or to fundamentally reduce the feasibility of fraud. Eliminate the public's doubts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No one wants this vaccine event to develop into the next melamine. After the vaccine is born, the vaccine will be better and not worse.</font></font></p>
