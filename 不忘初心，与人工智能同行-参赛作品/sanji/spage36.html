        <h2>New generation AI development plan</h2>
        <p>The rapid development of artificial intelligence will profoundly change the life of human society and change the world. In order to seize the great strategic opportunity for the development of artificial intelligence, build the first-mover advantage of the development of artificial intelligence in China, speed up the construction of an innovative country and a world power in science and technology, this plan is formulated in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council.</p>
        <h3>I. strategic posture</h3>
        <p>The development of AI has entered a new stage. After more than 60 years of evolution, especially driven by new theories and technologies such as mobile Internet, large data, supercomputing, sensor networks, brain science and the strong demand of economic and social development, artificial intelligence has accelerated its development, presenting new features such as in-depth learning, cross-border integration, man-machine collaboration, open group intelligence, and autonomous control. Sign. Large data-driven knowledge learning, cross-media collaborative processing, man-machine collaborative enhancement intelligence, swarm integrated intelligence, and autonomous intelligent system have become the development focus of artificial intelligence. Brain-like intelligence inspired by brain science research is ready to be launched. The trend of hardware-on-chip platform is more obvious. The development of artificial intelligence has entered a new stage. . At present, the development of new generation of artificial intelligence related disciplines, theoretical modeling, technological innovation, software and hardware upgrade, is triggering a chain breakthrough, promoting the economic and social fields from digital, networked to intelligent accelerated leap.</p>
        <p>Artificial intelligence has become a new focus of international competition. Artificial intelligence is a strategic technology to lead the future. The major developed countries in the world regard the development of artificial intelligence as an important strategy to enhance national competitiveness and safeguard national security. They have stepped up their planning and policies, intensified their deployment around core technologies, top talents, standards and norms, and strived to take the lead in the new round of international scientific and technological competition. Hold the lead. At present, China's national security and international competition situation are more complex. We must look at the whole world, put the development of artificial intelligence on the national strategic level, systematically layout and actively plan, firmly grasp the strategic initiative of international competition in the new stage of artificial intelligence development, create new competitive advantages, open up new space for development, and effectively safeguard National security. All.</p>
        <p>Artificial intelligence has become a new engine of economic development. Artificial intelligence, as the core driving force of a new round of industrial reform, will further release the enormous energy accumulated by previous scientific and technological revolutions and industrial reforms, create new powerful engines, reconstruct all links of economic activities, such as production, distribution, exchange and consumption, and form new demands for intellectualization from macroscopic to microcosmic fields, thus spawning new ones. Technologies, new products, new industries, new formats and new modes have led to major changes in the economic structure, profound changes in the way of production, life and thinking of mankind, and the overall leap in social productivity. China's economic development has entered a new normal state. It is very difficult to deepen the structural reform on the supply side. We must speed up the deep application of artificial intelligence, cultivate and strengthen the artificial intelligence industry, and inject new momentum into China's economic development.</p>
        <p>Artificial intelligence brings new opportunities for social construction. Our country is in the decisive stage of building a well-off society in an all-round way. The challenges of population aging, resources and environment constraints are still severe. Artificial intelligence is widely used in education, medical care, old-age care, environmental protection, urban operation, Judicial Services and other fields. It will greatly improve the precision of public services and comprehensively improve the quality of life of the people. Quality. Artificial intelligence technology can accurately perceive, predict, and warn the major situation of infrastructure and social security operation, timely grasp the group cognitive and psychological changes, active decision-making response, will significantly improve the ability and level of social governance, effective maintenance of social stability has an irreplaceable role.</p>
        <p>The uncertainty of AI development brings new challenges. Artificial intelligence is a disruptive technology with a wide range of impacts. It may bring about changes in employment structure, impact on law and social ethics, infringe on personal privacy, challenge the norms of international relations and other issues. It will have a far-reaching impact on government management, economic security and social stability, and even global governance. While vigorously developing artificial intelligence, we must attach great importance to the possible security risk challenges, strengthen forward-looking prevention and restraint guidance, minimize the risks, and ensure the safe, reliable and controllable development of artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>Our country has a good foundation for developing AI. The state has deployed key projects such as intelligent manufacturing and other key national R &amp; D programs, issued and implemented the implementation plan of "Internet +" artificial intelligence for three years, and put forward a series of measures from the aspects of R &amp; D, application and promotion, and industrial development. After years of continuous accumulation, China has made important progress in the field of artificial intelligence. The number of international scientific papers published and patents authorized has ranked second in the world. Some key technologies in the field have achieved important breakthroughs. Speech recognition and vision recognition are the world's leading technologies. Self-adaptive autonomous learning, intuitive perception, comprehensive reasoning, hybrid intelligence and swarm intelligence are preliminarily capable of leaping development. Chinese information processing, intelligent monitoring, biometric recognition, industrial robots, service robots and unmanned pilots are gradually coming into practical application. Artificial intelligence innovation and entrepreneurship have become increasingly active, and a number of leading enterprises have accelerated their growth, which has been widely concerned and recognized internationally. Accelerated accumulation of technical capabilities and massive data resources, huge application needs, open market environment organic combination, forming a unique advantage of the development of artificial intelligence in China.</p>
        <p>At the same time, we should also be soberly aware that the overall level of development of artificial intelligence in China is still lagging behind that of developed countries, lacking significant original achievements, and there is a big gap in scientific research in basic theory, core algorithms, key equipment, high-end chips, major products and systems, basic materials, components, software and interfaces, etc. Institutions and enterprises have not yet formed an Ecosphere and industrial chain with international influence, lacking a systematic and advanced R&amp;D layout; advanced talents of artificial intelligence are far from meeting the needs; infrastructure, policies and regulations, standard systems that adapt to the development of artificial intelligence need to be improved urgently.</p>
        <p>Faced with the new situation and new needs, we must take the initiative to change our response, firmly grasp the great historical opportunity of the development of artificial intelligence, keep abreast of the development, study the general situation, actively plan, grasp the direction and seize the opportunity, lead the new trend of the development of artificial intelligence in the world, serve the economic and social development and support national security, and promote the integrity of national competitiveness.
