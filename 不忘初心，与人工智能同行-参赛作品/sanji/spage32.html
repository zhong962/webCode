          <h1 class="title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Google "AI Guessing" circle of friends: user participation makes it smarter</font></font></h1>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One day after the launch, Google launched the first WeChat applet to guess the songs in some people's circle of friends, a large number of "soul painters" are happy to share their paintings in the circle of friends, but also issued many questions: Why do I paint like this, but AI can't guess?"</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the perspective of communication effects, Google's first WeChat applet can be said to have achieved great success.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Guessing a small song is a very simple little gameplay. The specific gameplay is that users and Google AI team up and sketch in a limited time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In each round of experience, the user needs to draw a picture of everyday items (such as dogs, watches, or shoes) within a specified time, and AI teammates need to guess the objects in the picture before the end of time.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the AI ​​guesses the object in the picture, the user will enter the next round, and the user's guessing winning streak will increase accordingly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Users can also invite friends or family to challenge the longest winning streak, share interesting sketches, and collect new questions and drawings as they progress.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Guess the list provided by the song shows that a current apprentice-level user is ranked first in the list for 288 paintings that can be accurately identified by the AI ​​in 25 minutes and 30 seconds.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s311.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Guessing the scores in a small song may not be directly proportional to your painting skills. In fact, many users will encounter such a situation in the process of experience: obviously, some of the items have been vividly painted, but AI just can't guess. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To answer this question, you must understand how the guessing song works.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Guessing the recognition of the user's paintings by the small songs, using neural network technology, is based on the study of a large number of graffiti samples.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Google gave a brief introduction to it in the official description: As a kind of AI technology, computer vision technology allows computers to directly understand the visual information of the input and thus "see" the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This technology can identify your friends in a video call to add the corresponding tags, and can also help identify early diabetic symptoms on human fundus diagnostic images. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks to the "neural network" technology, computers can handle very well things that seem extremely difficult: for example, rough objects can identify what objects are. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now, the computer has been able to "see" a group of inked ears that you can graffiti at random. It may be a panda.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Specifically supporting this game is a recurrent neural network called RNN, which can use its internal memory to process input sequences of arbitrary timing, which makes it easier to handle handwriting recognition, speech recognition, etc. without segmentation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The so-called input sequence refers to the stroke sequence when writing, and the process before and after painting.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, as early as 2016, Google launched a quick version of the gameplay similar to the game: it randomly displays a noun and asks you to draw it in 20 seconds. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The player needs to simply outline the object with the mouse, and then Quick, Draw! will judge if you are drawing something like it.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although it seems that the game is simple and easy, it is an important part of Google's series of AI testing tools, which actually use neural network algorithms to judge the player's graffiti. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Google tried to use it to study how to make AI self-learning image recognition and optical character recognition - both of which are core topics in the AI ​​field.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A year later, Google released the data set behind the project. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Quick Draw dataset is a collection of 50 million drawings divided into 345 categories, all of which come from players of the Quick, Draw! game. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These paintings are time-stamped vector graphics with some metadata annotations, including what the player is asked to paint and the country where the player is.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The guessing song that triggered the circle of friends was also entrusted with a similar purpose: to give everyone the opportunity to experience human-computer interaction driven by artificial intelligence technology.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the process of continuous interaction with AI, players can see the process of AI guessing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And Google has made such a setting intimately, when the user clears an item, you can see how everyone describes the item - you may try when the picture data set of an item is displayed in front of you. Understand, in the eyes of AI, what is "ice cream".</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More importantly, every user who has experienced guessing a small song is actually training AI continuously through his own paintings based on his knowledge of the world.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just as Google’s speech was released when the quick draw dataset was released: it’s not just massive data, it’s an interesting mirror – it’s a perspective on how to engage the public in training machine learning systems in crowdsourced form, and how to create a reflection Datasets of different cultural backgrounds and concepts.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This sentence can also be used to describe the guessing song: this is not only a small program, but also a way for ordinary people to participate in training machine learning systems.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the point of view of Google's development of small programs, the international technology giant is working hard to find and find the most suitable way for Chinese users to participate in their own product and technology research and development.</font></font></p>
