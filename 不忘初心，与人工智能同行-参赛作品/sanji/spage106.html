          <h1 class="title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The scene revolution is coming, is AI still far behind?</font></font></h1>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you don't pay attention, the world will look different.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More than a hundred years ago, Marx said that time is the space for human development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Indeed, our productivity is getting higher and higher, artificial intelligence is gradually liberating human beings from basic labor, and technology has an unprecedented breakthrough. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, we found that time seems to be less and less useful. From BAT to TMD to PKQ, various super apps are about to divide our time, and humans are willing to be squeezed. There is no doubt that human emotions are coming. The stronger it is.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we say that the past 20 years have completely completed the migration from offline to online, then we see that today’s time and space seem to be one, and the Internet of Everything is reassembling the world, with users as the center. The scene revolution is coming to us.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The revolution of the scene, the discovery of innovative genes</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today, if a store says it must be cash or swipe, it will definitely be considered a monster. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unmanned, shared, instant, and intelligent have become essential functions for every new scene. Black technologies such as AR, VR, and intelligent robots have become commonplace tools, and the scene is coated with a layer of fantasy.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Nothing can't be done, only can't think of it" is the best annotation of this era. We are very optimistic to see that a beautiful world and a lot of opportunities are in front of us. Innovation, entrepreneurship, transformation, and upgrading have become fashionable, but business still remains. Difficult to do, the capital has been repeatedly hit by the cold winter, entrepreneurs frequently swear by themselves, what does the scene revolution bring to us?</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tracing back to the source, the essence of the scene revolution is to satisfy people's needs and emotions, and today's needs are becoming more and more personalized. No matter what kind of scenario, whether enterprises can grasp the changing users is a key indicator of success. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Drip locks the convenience of travel, and the vibrato sounds the market of emotional resonance. The multi-pointer is directed at low-cost sharing. The rapid rise of these unicorns is a model innovation grafted on the scene revolution, and all aim at "people." "This element.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The scene revolution brings us the soil of innovation and the tool to connect users. Big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things are all essential elements in this soil. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It can be said that without these underlying technology foundations, these enterprises have no room for growth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The new species was born in this soil, and it is easy to make a blockbuster. For the "old business" that has been growing for several years, it is not easy to make a face-lift in the scene revolution.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, they are not without a way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The answer is simple, find your own breakthrough point and carry out fission upgrades. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The biggest feature of the scene revolution is the fusion, online and offline unbounded, virtual and reality interaction. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have seen that Internet giants are rushing to find opportunities, and offline business competitions are on the way to find ways. The home of the scene revolution is online, and it is doubtful that this wave belongs to the real economy because of its wired genes. It has someone's data.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The physical economy is worried? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It’s time for sports.</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Economist Guan Qingyou said that our financial scale is getting bigger and bigger, and physical enterprises are getting more and more thirsty. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the surface, it is not easy for an entity to jump out of a cage. There is no money, no technology, and only a bunch of heavy assets that can't be lost. It is already lucky to be able to walk.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All companies want to use big data and want to use artificial intelligence, because these technologies can bring about productivity improvement and improve efficiency. But after so many years, many companies only stay in the shallow layers of automation and digitalization. AI has become an unattainable concept.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, many companies have a misunderstanding about data and even intelligence. It is not just to install a software system, open an online store, or put a no-shelf shelf in the store, which improves efficiency to a certain extent. However, there is no traffic and no members. These devices are nothing more than furnishings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the production side, it is in vain to not understand the user's needs and produce a large number of products that cannot be sold, resulting in overcapacity.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The key to improving efficiency is to open up the user's needs and various scenarios, and establish a business closed loop of production scenarios, logistics scenarios, and consumption scenarios. This is the real efficiency improvement. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The source of all this is the offline data. No matter where people go, the offline data is in the same shape. It can be said that it is the first generation of users. Just like Yan Yanchun, a partner of Shengjing Network, the offline data is not falling. The data on the ground is the true greatest scene data.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Using scene data to understand users, transform scenes, and improve efficiency is the inevitable result of the scene revolution, and many companies have begun to notice this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the other hand, the real economy is thirsty but no one is sending water. It is because they are empty and offline, but they lack awareness of the continuous flow of data. In fact, offline data has become an asset of the enterprise. As the basis for the evaluation of the value of the enterprise, with the data, there is naturally a source of living water.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Offline data is both productivity and intangible assets. Only when it is cognitively changed can it be rewarded in action.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The spring of offline traffic is coming, AI landing brings industrial upgrading</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the era of offline traffic, offline data has become the core element of new business, but it does not mean that offline data can be safe. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Offline data has occupied a high ground for us, but if it is not well applied, the road will be difficult to walk. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because the transformation and upgrading of enterprises is not a one-time process, it is the result of the common evolution of various production factors.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artificial intelligence has to be mentioned here, because artificial intelligence is the most direct means of liberating productivity, and it is the hurdle that industrial upgrading cannot overcome. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And AI and big data are even more difficult to understand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The development of AI itself is to improve the algorithm and computing power to process the data, and the other is to obtain more data, which means that the accumulation of data will promote the evolution of AI technology, and every step of AI will be The opportunity for enterprise development.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AI has been floating in the sky. On the one hand, data accumulation is not enough. On the other hand, business scenarios have not been synchronized, so there is nowhere to go. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, unmanned driving has been studied for many years. It seems that it is not practical to use it for the public. For example, Alpha Dog, although defeating humans in Go, is currently limited to scientific research; for example, face recognition, each company has its own Systematic, far from true intelligent applications.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The role of offline data is to make everyone online, and every scene is online. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Allied data founder &amp; CEO Guangyu Yu said that what online data can do, what offline data can do, and the value of offline data is greater, because offline data has more dimensions and more volume. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The future is the world of all things connected. Everything is the premise and foundation of business intelligence, and the connection of each IoT endpoint is inseparable from the support of offline data.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When each scene is like a web page and an APP, it can be digitized and intelligent. When the AI ​​has contacts and switches, landing is not a problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For enterprises, there is an entrance to the user connection, whether online or offline, it is enough to find the user's demand point and touch point. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nowadays, smart stores and smart homes are just enough to make us marvel at the prototype of smart scenes. It is hard to imagine how much technology and data are combined.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The scene revolution is not a concept. It is the change we can feel when we are at home, walking on the street, flying in the sky. This wave makes intelligence more and more close to our lives. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, as far as the development of offline data is concerned, this has only just begun. When the data has accumulated enough, we will see a more wonderful world in which the business opportunities are self-evident. What we have to do is to grasp the present. Everyone has a chance.</font></font></p>
