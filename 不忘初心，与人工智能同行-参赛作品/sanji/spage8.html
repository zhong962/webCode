          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the results of the college entrance examinations are announced each year, many candidates will choose to be professionally guilty. So, do they have any troubles in this area, and which majors do they prefer?</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the results of the national college entrance examination in 2018, we sent a “2018 college entrance examination questionnaire survey” to more than 60 candidates from 31 provinces across the country. A total of 27 valid questionnaires were collected, covering college entrance examinations in 19 provinces. .</font></font></p>

          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the above survey, nearly 50% of the respondents who participated in the volunteers were ranked in the professional rankings, while 30% of the interviewed candidates were most concerned with the school rankings. The other candidates who were interviewed were most concerned about the city and environment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nearly 75% of the candidates interviewed have clear professional goals, and the rest of the candidates are hesitant in professional selection.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, more than 60% of the interviewed candidates tend to apply for economics, management and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">New engineering majors such as artificial intelligence are also highly regarded by candidates. More than half of the candidates surveyed “will consider and would like to apply for a new engineering major”.</font></font></p>

          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of professionalism, Yu Chu (pseudonym), a candidate from the Northwest Territories, tends to be in economic management. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Managing wealth is more interesting than earning other people's wealth." Yu Chu believes that the management profession "communicates with people", parents do not want him to be a nerd. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"To be more in touch with people, several of my friends are also this major."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the survey, the popular majors selected by the candidates are mainly “economics” and “management”. Among the multiple-choice questions in the questionnaire about “what kind of specialty is preferred”, 44.44% of the candidates interviewed Economics was chosen, and the number of candidates who chose to manage the program also reached 22.22%.</font></font></p>

          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tianjin Science candidate Zhou Yan said that he has received the admission letter from Peking University and started school in September. She will officially become one of the freshmen of Peking University Guanghua School of Management. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“When I saw some books on economics and finance in the third day of junior high school, I began to be interested in finance.” Zhou Yan said frankly that when the dream came into reality, the moment he received the acceptance letter, he was very excited.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Peng Yuxin (a pseudonym), a liberal arts candidate in a province in the north, chose the Peking University School of Economics, claiming that this choice belongs to “mistaken mistakes”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"At the beginning, it was quite common, because I didn't have a clear preference." Peng Yuxin said that after consulting Peking University's enrollment teachers and seniors, he felt that economics was "very appetizing," and he decided.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In her view, this subject is a way of thinking, using data, models, reasoning, and analysis to rationally interpret the way the objective world operates, revealing the essence through the appearance of seemingly different things. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"As a 'atypical liberal arts student', the rigor, accuracy and rationality of the economy is quite consistent with me." Peng Yuxin said that he "does enough of the essays" and prefers to "strongly argue and persuade" himself. thing.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Literary science from Liaoning, Tianshi, successfully entered the Guanghua School of Management at Tsinghua University to study economic management. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shi Tianle told the news that many students joked that "the test into Guanghua is falling into the eyes of money", he believes that this is the "stereotype" of the society for related professions.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For him, the economic conditions at home are acceptable, and he is not in a hurry to make money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"I would like to do something to serve the society and do some industry. But to do business, it is necessary to have a knowledge base and financial support. It is useless to rely on mouth guns." Shi Tianle thinks that he has "the economy and the people" Ambition, willing to "do things in a down-to-earth manner", and entering Tsinghua is a good starting point. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"I use my own economic knowledge to support the development of some emerging industries. This is what I yearn for."</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I hope to become a "composite talent"</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unlike other well-specified candidates, Liu Meng, a Jiangxi liberal arts candidate, chose to enroll in the Xinya College of Tsinghua University, leaving a "suspense" for his college career.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Xinya Academy is a special “Institute of Accommodation and Liberal Arts” established by Tsinghua University in 2014 to explore the reform and innovation of undergraduate education. Students are not required to be professional at the time of enrollment. They first accept small class general education based on mathematics, humanities and social sciences. After that, you can freely choose the various professional directions of Tsinghua University (except for individual majors such as clinical medicine), or choose interdisciplinary development.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Xinya College is at the forefront of education reform. It conforms to the trend of no clues, let you explore and cultivate your own interests, and then choose the direction to go in the future." Liu Meng said that as far as her understanding is concerned, the society needs more now. Many "composite talents", if they limit themselves to the liberal arts, will narrow the path of their future development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The liberal arts is the way I want to go in the future, but in the liberal arts study, I also use the science of thinking to expand the angle. I choose Tsinghua Xinya, that is, choose the challenge, escape the ease track and inertia thinking."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anhui Science and Technology Bafang Qingyuan also hopes to become a "composite talent." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to his introduction, his father is a computer technician in the local tax system. For the current hot engineering major, his father suggested that he should not choose a pure computer major. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fang Qingyuan is quite in favor of this, and he is more willing to become a cross-disciplinary talent in multiple fields.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhang Qian (pseudonym) from Yunnan was admitted to the Chinese Department of Peking University this year, but she hopes that the school's "general education" concept will enable her to develop in an all-round way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"What I lack is to use science and engineering knowledge and thinking to consider problems. It is often sensuous, easy-going, and not rational." Zhang Qian hopes to accept general education and take a basic course in science to "cultivate certain rationality." thinking". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Undergraduate students should focus on popularizing general education and cultivating comprehensive and interdisciplinary and diverse talents. This should be the goal of undergraduate education. Graduate students and doctoral students are biased towards academic research."</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">New engineering majors such as artificial intelligence are receiving attention</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not long ago, the Ministry of Education issued the "Notice on the publication of the first batch of "new engineering" research and practice projects". A total of 612 projects from universities across the country were selected, including popular professional direction such as artificial intelligence, big data, and intelligent manufacturing. 19 project groups are covered. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Relevant majors are also highly regarded by candidates. More than half of the candidates interviewed “will consider and would like to apply for a new engineering major”.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Guizhou science examiner Yan Hongwei said that his target professional direction is "computer", because he has been interested in "electronic technology" since he was a senior. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to its introduction, he won the provincial second prize of the Robotics Engineering Competition of Guizhou Province and the second prize of the provincial high school group of the first open source electronic design competition in Guizhou Province.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yan Hongwei’s idol is Nan Rendong, a science and technology worker who died of illness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"He has lung cancer but has been conducting research in the mountainous areas of Guizhou for more than a decade. He likes this spirit very much and contributes to the country. He hopes to become such a person in the future." Yan Hongwei said.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the survey, 33.33% of the respondents indicated that they are very interested in the artificial intelligence industry and plan to engage in related industries.</font></font></p>

          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yan Hongwei said that he usually pays more attention to "artificial intelligence" and hopes to develop in this field in the future. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The current 'artificial intelligence' is flawed, it is difficult to have real emotions like human beings, I hope to break through this flaw." Yan Hongwei told the news that he is very interested in the competition and hopes to be friendly with outstanding students in the university. Do more research projects with teachers.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Liu Meng's view, as a major focus of the current national education construction, the "new engineering" heat is inevitable because of the high social demand, good employment and high wages. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"New engineering with more emphasis on practicality will also promote the reform of the education system, and further promote the need for cross-disciplinary integration, because whether it is artificial intelligence or cloud computing, or the upgrading of traditional engineering, it is no longer a professional. Completed."</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Selecting literature and history subjects based on love</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The liberal arts disciplines such as philosophy, literature, and history have not been too neglected by the school tyrants. More than 40% of the surveyed candidates tend to apply for relevant majors.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The liberal arts master Zhou Junrou from Guangxi had a special liking for the Chinese department of Peking University and was successfully admitted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"I originally wanted to report on philosophy, I feel that I will be pressing online Peking University. Later, the scores are higher, and the Chinese department can also report. After entering the university, I am not ready to give up philosophy. I will consider minors in the future." Zhou Junrou told Yu News.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s75.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhou Junrou's idol is the writer "August Changan", who studied at Peking University Guanghua School of Management. Zhou Junrou took the above road and chose Peking University Chinese major to be affected to some extent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The first choice for the liberal arts is because my academic performance is quite good. After reading her book, I was affected. Some important characters in her novels are those who chose liberal arts. At that time, some teachers persuaded me to say that my science is also very good, but choose There is no right or wrong." Zhou Junrou said.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the future, Zhou Junrou said that "I have never thought of becoming a writer." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"I don't want to use my identity as a home to frame myself. I usually write something when I want to write something. I am more willing to study than writing a book. I want to do academics in the future. Even though I am still in the society, I still want to keep a copy. Longing for."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhang Qian told Yu News that attending the Chinese Department of Peking University is her dream of persisting in her childhood. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"I am hoping that I will go to Peking University Guanghua School of Management, but I am not interested." Zhang Qian said.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In her view, "the Chinese department can't adapt to the hot industry now" is a misunderstanding. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Even "artificial intelligence" can't rely on English alone, but also Chinese. But Chinese is more complicated than English, and applied linguistics talents are equally scarce for artificial intelligence development." Zhang Qian believes that Chinese graduates are not only engaged in graduation. Journalists, literary criticism, teachers and other professions, the profession can adapt to all walks of life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Chinese majors can train my thinking and thinking ability, no matter what career I am going to do, I will be very helpful.”</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, Zhang Qian is also very interested in history. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"I want to learn the pre-Qin literature, but literature can not be separated from the times to study separately, so I plan to study Chinese and history after entering the university." Zhang Qian said.</font></font></p>
