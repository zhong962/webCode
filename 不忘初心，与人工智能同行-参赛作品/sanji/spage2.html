            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Last week, the Youth Survey Joint Questionnaire Network conducted a survey of 2010 respondents that 86.1% of respondents were concerned about the application of artificial intelligence technology in the medical field, and 68.5% of respondents considered the value of medical artificial intelligence. To improve the diagnostic efficiency, 75.3% of the respondents felt that the application of artificial intelligence technology in the medical field would make it easier to see a doctor, and 82.9% of the respondents expected the application of artificial intelligence technology in the medical field.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">86.1% of respondents are concerned about the application of artificial intelligence technology in the medical field</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Xu Jiahang (pseudonym), a senior student in biomedical engineering at a university in Shanghai, has participated in a science and technology team to do capsule gastroscope combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning projects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"At that time, we used image processing technology to learn machine-based methods, and gave the capsule robot a large number of patient case pictures, let it learn and remember independently, and on this basis, learn how to distinguish whether the user's stomach has ulcers."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhou Wei (pseudonym), a sophomore major in oral clinical medicine at a university in Guangdong, told reporters that the current application of artificial intelligence technology in the medical field mainly involves medical robots, drug research and development, intelligent diagnosis and treatment and health management. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"For example, medical robots can assist in the diagnosis and treatment, and intelligent prostheses can read human nerve signals and become intelligent exoskeletons."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the survey, 86.1% of respondents are concerned about the application of artificial intelligence technology in the medical field, and 13.9% of respondents are not concerned. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">56.6% of the respondents had an understanding of the application of artificial intelligence technology in the medical field, 25.9% of the respondents said that they knew the level, and 7.6% of the respondents said they did not understand.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhou Wei believes that the value of medical artificial intelligence is first reflected in its resolution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Artificial intelligence can collect large amounts of data and analyze it through big data, and then conduct accurate judgment through in-depth diagnosis and treatment to help doctors make more accurate diagnosis and treatment. In addition, artificial intelligence also has a very important application in medical research education. Traditional teaching Some experiments need to be repeated on the computer repeatedly, because there will always be some systematic errors or accidental errors. This error will cause the experimental results to be not as expected. But we use artificial intelligence to simulate on the computer and then give It is easy to come up with the answers we expected, out of the environment and requirements it needs."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the survey, 68.5% of the respondents believe that the value of medical artificial intelligence is to improve the diagnostic efficiency and make up for the gap between supply and demand of resources. 54.7% of the respondents believe that medical artificial intelligence can assist doctors in diagnosis and alleviate the misdiagnosis of missed diagnosis, 53.9% of the interviews Medical artificial intelligence can provide disease risk warning and health advisory services. 38.7% of respondents believe that medical artificial intelligence can support drug development and improve pharmaceutical efficiency. 29.5% of respondents understand that surgical robots can improve surgical precision. .</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Xu Jiahang believes that the application of artificial intelligence in the medical field not only shoulders the burden of doctors and other practitioners, but also shortens the diagnosis time and relieves the suffering of patients to varying degrees, and can also indirectly alleviate many problems, such as doctor-patient relationship and medical treatment. The cost is too high.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhou Wei believes that artificial intelligence technology can help graded diagnosis and treatment, and achieve "big disease hospital treatment, small disease small hospital treatment." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The patient does not have to go to the big hospital in order to see a cold, so that some really seriously ill patients can be treated in time.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the survey, 75.3% of respondents felt that medical artificial intelligence would make it easier to see a doctor, 10.6% of respondents did not think so, and 14.2% said it was difficult to say.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ma Jianguo, an associate professor in the Department of Measurement and Control and Information Technology at Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, said that the application of artificial intelligence technology in the medical field can alleviate the workload of many people. "But now it is not very mature, efficiency, accuracy, etc. are not enough guarantee. The most basic The most primitive data is the root of all algorithms, and research on raw data and instruments needs to make a breakthrough. Many reports say that medical artificial intelligence diagnosis is more accurate than doctors, so it needs to be cautious.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">62.1% of respondents expect medical artificial intelligence for medical image recognition</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ma Jianguo told reporters that at present, in the hospital, medical artificial intelligence "doctors" are still used very little. They only make a lot of comparisons in research, but most of the time they still need people to deal with them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The current difficulty is mainly the use of raw data and instruments. Some machines are not necessarily conducive to the use and acquisition of data by computers. There are also algorithms and hardware that have improved a lot compared to previous years, but they also need artificial intelligence. processor".</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are the problems in the development of medical artificial intelligence? In the survey, 34.1% of the respondents believe that the problem lies in the lack of sufficient quantity and high quality data of format standards, and 23.5% of the respondents feel that the personal medical records are sensitive and need to be strict. Privacy protection, 20.6% of respondents believe that the shortage of doctors, nurses and other medical personnel in related fields is a problem, 18.6% of respondents believe that patients may not trust artificial intelligence</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Now medical artificial intelligence is not completely intelligent. For example, it can judge the depth of the wound or the infection, but it is not possible to make a reasonable diagnosis. It is impossible to prescribe the right medicine or give a later nursed back plan. In addition, the current data foundation is also Did not build well." Zhou Wei said.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Xu Jiahang told reporters that the application of artificial intelligence in the medical field is unique, including the complexity and diversity of cases, which has led to the current accuracy of machine learning that we have not yet achieved. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, it is difficult to achieve the large-scale integration of artificial intelligence and medical treatment into the clinic. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"But with the development of technology and the accumulation of data, I believe that there will be a breakthrough soon."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the survey, 82.9% of respondents expect artificial intelligence technology to be applied in the medical field. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">62.1% of respondents expect medical artificial intelligence technology for medical image recognition, 61.2% of respondents hope that it can help medical institutions to visualize big data and increase data value, 50.2% of respondents hope that it can promote medical institutions Informatization, 38.9% of respondents expect it to be applied in health management services, and 29.2% of respondents hope that it can promote precision medicine.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The shadow of artificial intelligence medical treatment often appears in science fiction movies. Maybe one day, people will go to the medical cabin when they are sick, and they can fully solve all diseases and injuries without any problem." Xu Jiahang said that he is very much looking forward to artificial intelligence. The application of technology in the medical field.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ma Jianguo said that medical artificial intelligence is first and foremost a tool to assist and help doctors. "Now artificial intelligence can't be separated from doctors, but it is difficult to predict in the future. For example, pathological pictures are not very easy to read by human eyes, but artificial intelligence can be compared. Clearly read; there is also research on the brain. If the front-end information processor is in place, artificial intelligence should be able to perform deep operations on brain research later."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among the respondents who participated in the survey, 1.4% after 00, 34.4% after 90, 48.9% after 80, 10.9% after 70, and 4.3% after 60.</font></font></p>
