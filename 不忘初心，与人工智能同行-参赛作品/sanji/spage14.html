          <h1 class="title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tencent cloud audio and video AI technology, "the behind-the-scenes hero" of the high-speed HD World Cup live broadcast</font></font></h1>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In a blink of an eye, the World Cup is nearing its end. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whether you know the ball or not, whether you know the ball or not, people's topics during the World Cup are indispensable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Looking back at each World Cup, there are new technologies to help the fans to truly feel the beauty of the World Cup, the passion and sweat of the World Cup. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This year's World Cup is still inseparable from the support of new technologies, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, such as a change in the past live TV, using a new media platform for live webcast.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the end of May, the Central Radio and Television Station decided to distribute the World Cup new media copyright. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to achieve a clear and smooth live broadcast effect, CCTV finally chose Tencent Cloud to provide fast HD live broadcast technology support. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I believe that the live broadcast of the World Cup, the clarity and smoothness of CCTV and CCTV video and audio should leave a deep impression on many people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then, behind the HD live broadcast, what new technology is used by Tencent Cloud? Why does CCTV select Tencent Cloud?</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The biggest challenge in sports events: clarity and fluency</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the past, viewers only watched the World Cup on TV. It was very small when the picture was stuck or unclear. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the live webcast is not as stable as the live broadcast of the TV. Due to factors such as network bandwidth, the probability of picture cardon, audio and video timestamps being out of sync, etc. is high.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Usually, in order to ensure smooth viewing of the video, the user has to lower the video bit rate and select a smooth or standard definition picture to watch the video. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, for a heavyweight event like the World Cup, this is obviously not the result of the audience and the broadcaster. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, video is the most bandwidth-intensive content form on the Internet. Realizing the clarity and smoothness of video high-frequency motion pictures has always been the biggest challenge for Internet sports events.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, how can we ensure that users watch the quality of the live broadcast and ensure the clarity of the picture? How does Tencent Cloud do it?</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s131.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the recent Tencent Cloud Media Salon, Li Haiqi, senior product manager of Tencent Cloud, said: "For video companies, bandwidth spending accounts for a large part of operating costs. If you want to provide users with high-definition video experience, you must increase the video stream. The code rate and the total cost of the corresponding bandwidth will be further improved. Tencent Cloud Extreme HD is solving this problem and can provide users with higher definition video at a lower bit rate."</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The technology behind CCTV World Cup live broadcast - Tencent Cloud Extreme HD</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Li Haiqi told reporters that there are many quality problems in ordinary transcoding technology, such as transcoding distortion, low resolution blur, lens jitter, loud noise, low bit rate sawtooth block and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These are some of the basic issues to deal with during the entire transcoding process.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tencent Cloud Extreme Speed ​​HD technology (also known as "Intelligent Dynamic Coding Technology") mainly uses machine depth learning, intelligent classification of video scenes, coding parameter matching, pre-processing, coding dynamic optimization, code rate intelligent control, detail reduce, ROI processing. Such technologies and processes intelligently process live or on-demand video streams to match optimal coding parameters, thereby providing users with a higher-definition live video stream at a lower bandwidth cost.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The technology will classify the real-time recognition results according to the scene, and combine the video source rate, frame rate, resolution, texture and motion variation, and the dimensions of the integrated machine load and image quality to select the optimal coding parameters. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, in the image quality processing, it can be classified according to different scenes, combined with video source picture texture and real-time motion detection results to sharpen, softly blur, de-interlace, deblock, denoise, color scale compensation, frame down, etc. Set processing.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to reports, Tencent Cloud Extreme Speed ​​HD technology mainly realizes intelligent coding of live video stream through three modules, namely: scene intelligent recognition, video dynamic coding and video enhancement.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the aspect of intelligent recognition of the scene, during the high-speed HD technology service, the live stream can be detected and analyzed in real time, and the corresponding scene model is matched. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the video stream situation to identify the scene of the live video, whether it is a sporting event, if it is, football, basketball or tennis. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, smart recognition is also adopted for a single scene. If it is a football match, it is necessary to identify in real time whether it is a close shot, whether it is a distant view, whether it is a shot or the like. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then, the real-time recognition result is classified according to the scene, and the video is dynamically encoded. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Match the current base code library first, then match the next more detailed code base according to the real-time motion scene. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finally, implement video enhancements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The key areas of concern to the audience have been enhanced and the non-key areas have been weakened. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, the audience area and the billboard area can be weakened.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why does CCTV choose Tencent Cloud?</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As the most important customer in the entire video cloud industry, CCTV is a must for all cloud vendors. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before the World Cup, CCTV decided to introduce new technologies to enhance the clarity of the game during the World Cup. Each cloud service provider provided its own solution.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tencent Cloud has carried out dozens of service upgrades and optimizations in modules such as rate control, deblurring, deblocking, de-interlacing, motion search and block decision. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After a round of PK, CCTV finally chose Tencent Cloud. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With a resolution of 1024*576 and a frame rate of 25, Tencent Cloud Extreme HD technology achieves a lower bit rate of 887 kbps, and the remaining two cloud service vendors have a code rate of 963 kbps and 941 kbps. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The VMAF model is used to evaluate video quality. Tencent's cloud code rate is about 8%-10% less than that of friends.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"During the opening ceremony of the World Cup, while the live broadcast problems were frequent, it was the CCTV audio and video supported by Tencent's ultra-fast HD technology, which achieved a counterattack in word of mouth," said Lu Lin, senior engineer of Tencent Cloud.</font></font></p>
          </div>
          <div class="one">
            <img src="./simg/s132.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
          </div>
          <div class="two">
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Talking about the support experience of the World Cup live broadcast, Lu Lin said: "In fact, as early as this year's Spring Festival, Tencent Cloud has begun to deepen the study of the World Cup game scene." After the Spring Festival this year, Tencent Cloud's ultra-fast HD service began to access some heads. The game live platform and got good feedback.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Previously, Tencent's cloud web crawler football game video exceeded 500 games. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For each game video, high-speed motion scene, football follow-up model training, long-term lens optimization, wonderful playback ROI area enhancement, audience expression capture and other details to do some visual effects analysis and optimization effect evaluation to achieve the optimal dynamic coding model.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before the World Cup, Tencent Cloud has promoted the rapid HD service to Dragon Ball Live and Xinying Sports in the Super League and Premier League events, and began to train the AI ​​model they built. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They found that there are many different places between the Super League and the Premier League. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Super League's game rhythm is slower than the Premier League, which requires them to make more targeted adjustments for different models.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The pace of the World Cup matches is roughly between the Super League and the Premier League, but it is more inclined to the fast pace of the Premier League. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, during the World Cup they also matched the previous AI model with the World Cup.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, on the eve of the time-critical World Cup, Tencent Cloud also took out a new privatization program, set up a set of Tencent cloud speed HD transcoding cluster in CCTV network, support CCTV5 channel live broadcast during CCTV World Cup, RTMP /FLV push-pull source stream, support CCTV RTMP/FLV/HLS pull stream after transcoding.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finally, before the World Cup, Tencent Cloud was compatible with the various hardware and equipment software modules and software code modules. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, the service indicators of this program are all normal, and the outflow effect is also beyond expectations. The broadcast effect is obvious compared with other platforms.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AI plus audio and video, speed, high flexibility</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reporter learned that Tencent Cloud Extreme Speed ​​HD technology is one of the most important features of Tencent Cloud Audio Video AI solution.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not long ago, at 2018 Tencent Cloud at the "Cloud + Future" Summit, in order to solve the cost and technical problems faced by the game live broadcast industry, Tencent Cloud released the audio and video AI solution - Ming Hao. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The combination of audio and video technology and AI artificial intelligence will wipe out what kind of sparks, Tencent Yunming's ability is the best proof.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tencent Minghao can intelligently judge the type of video scenes, optimize the processing of different types of videos, and provide users with a higher-definition viewing experience with lower bandwidth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It can be said that Tencent video cloud has sufficient understanding of AI. Tencent Minghao covers four core functions of ultra-fast HD, intelligent motion, intelligent editing and intelligent subtitles. It can include videos such as pan-live entertainment, online video, short video, and new media. The whole industry chain, specific implementation, including narrowband HD, super resolution, dynamic coding, body language recognition, smart pendant, beauty skin, portrait retrieval, smart cover, smart tag, voice recognition, real-time translation, mixed stream output, etc. Multiple application scenarios within the AI ​​technology are fully reflected.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among them, the ultra-fast HD service uses AI technology to clearly determine the video scene type. For different segments in the same video, the application is completely different from the IBP frame type, quantization parameter QP, resolution and other coding parameters, so as not to reduce the video quality. Reduce the video bit rate and reduce the CDN bandwidth.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With Tencent's years of resources and technology accumulation in the video field, Tencent Cloud has built a video cloud ecosystem, which not only provides technical support for enterprises, but also reaches resources cooperation with enterprises to help 80% of Top broadcast enterprises develop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the “Cloud+Future” summit, Tencent Cloud released a new audio and video AI solution and Tencent-RTC to further improve and evolve its ecology.</font></font></p>
