            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tree-climbing robots, calligraphy robots, rescue robots, service robots... Today, more and more robots are approaching us, adding a lot of fun to life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, what level of robotics and artificial intelligence technology has developed? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How much impact will it bring to the social economy? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What entrepreneurial investment opportunities can people find? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the National Artificial Intelligence Conference, which was closed in Beijing recently, experts, scholars and industry professionals from related fields conducted in-depth exchanges and discussions on the latest hotspots and development trends in the field of artificial intelligence.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From machine to robot</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the birth of the robot, people have been trying to explain what robots are, but they have been talking differently. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In recent years, the research and development of robots has developed rapidly, and some practical robots have come out one after another. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, can these machines that dance, sweep, and sing, can they be called robots? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Are they smart enough?</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Now robots are more than just an automated machine. They don't have real intelligence. They can't be robots." Zhu Xiaochao, co-founder of domestic small i robots, said that developers have been on robots for a long time. Brainstorming, but neglecting the study of robot intelligence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Robots should be an application and comprehensive manifestation of artificial intelligence. It is people-oriented and let the machine do the work of people."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Xu Yangsheng, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), also said that robots should have the ability to act, perceive, and recognize. In the past, scientists’ research in the past 50 years has focused on robotic movements without considering intelligence. problem.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　So what exactly should an intelligent robot look like in a strict sense? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zhao Jie, a professor at Harbin Institute of Technology, said: "Intelligent robots should be machines with the ability to sense, think, make decisions and execute, and help people achieve their life and production goals." He also said that concepts will change with the development of technology, robots The development goal is not just to be a human-like machine, but to have real intelligence and powerful features.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nowadays, in the face of many bottlenecks in the development of traditional artificial intelligence, the academic community and the industry are actively studying, and strive to improve the level of artificial intelligence technology, so that robots can move from "moving freely" to "can listen to" to "can understand" ", to promote the transformation of the machine to the robot. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Although some of the behaviors shown by machinery or computers seem to be intelligent, this is not enough. Our goal is to make the machine truly capable of independent thinking,” said Hu Yu, senior vice president of Science and Technology.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Liu Chenglin, director of the State Key Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the most important aspects of artificial intelligence are perception and cognitive ability. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pattern recognition based on deep learning and big data is an important aspect. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the future, the combination of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence will enable robots to implement content recognition, adaptive learning, small sample learning, multimodal learning, multitasking collaboration and many other functions.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Experts generally believe that artificial intelligence technology will bring significant impact to the world in the future and become a new round of technology feast. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From action to intelligence, from machine to robot, this process will reshape the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, the Chinese government attaches great importance to the development and research of artificial intelligence, and is increasing investment in scientific research, striving to achieve deep integration of machines and artificial intelligence, and to enhance the "intelligence" of robots. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, the country will gradually launch the "China Brain Project", and the research on "brain-like intelligence" has begun.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Leading a new round of industrial revolution</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Industrialization of wisdom is a major trend in national development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As the key technology in the era of information intelligence, artificial intelligence has increasingly become the engine of a new round of industrial revolution, which will profoundly affect the international industrial competition pattern and the international competitiveness of a country.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although China's artificial intelligence technology research and industrial applications started late, and there are problems such as high technical costs, the development momentum is good. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The intelligent scientific and technological achievements such as text recognition, speech recognition, Chinese information processing, intelligent monitoring, biometrics recognition, industrial robots and service robots of China's independent intellectual property rights have been widely used.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2016, sales of industrial robots in China's market soared by 54% to 56,000 units. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2016, the scale of China's intelligent voice interaction industry reached 10 billion yuan; the scale of fingerprint recognition, face recognition and iris recognition reached 10 billion yuan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, China already has a well-equipped R&amp;D institution such as the State Key Laboratory and an excellent R&amp;D team of artificial intelligence. The quantity and quality of R&amp;D output have also been greatly improved. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many companies are also actively deploying, such as Baidu's "Baidu Brain" program, Keda Xunfei "Super Brain Project", Jingdong smart chat robot.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Liu Jinchang, a researcher at the High Technology Research and Development Center of the Ministry of Science and Technology, believes that the rapid development of artificial intelligence and robotics in China in recent years is inseparable from two important reasons: first, the country's high attention and policy support, and second, the attention of the financial community and large enterprises. Constantly entering.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the opening ceremony of the academicians of the two academies, General Secretary Xi Jinping focused on robots and artificial intelligence at the opening ceremony. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the "Government Work Report", Premier Li Keqiang also proposed the "Made in China 2025" strategic plan, and clarified the direction of intelligent manufacturing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Exploration and research of artificial intelligence has risen to the national strategic level and has a good development trend." Liu Jinchang said.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, the arrival of "Internet +" and the era of big data has brought new changes and business opportunities to the current artificial intelligence industry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“The Internet and big data are pushing artificial intelligence to usher in a new spring.” Tan Tieniu, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said, “The booming of big data in recent years has provided artificial intelligence with the vast amount of data needed for deep learning, and the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Inseparable."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Under the historical opportunity, the in-depth study of artificial intelligence in China is gaining momentum. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The field of artificial intelligence in China is taking "Internet +" and "Made in China 2025" as an opportunity to seize the historical opportunity of the second machine revolution, aiming at the development trend of international artificial intelligence, based on the actual needs of China's recent social development, and coordinating the integration of domestic related Resources, scientifically set development goals, and vigorously develop artificial intelligence technologies and industries.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The field of artificial intelligence must strengthen the education of artificial intelligence and the high-quality talents of science and technology, attach importance to the forward-looking basic research of artificial intelligence, and build an open and shared artificial intelligence innovation development platform to fully share resources. In the future, the development of artificial intelligence in China, Both the promotion at the national level and the continuous efforts of the academic field and the industry are needed," said Tan Tieniu.</font></font></p>
            <h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Entrepreneurial innovation gold mine</font></font></h3>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Experts attending the conference believe that the integration of artificial intelligence and robots will surely become the highlight of the future development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then, will the artificial intelligence, the rich mine, become the next venture for innovation in 5 or 10 years?</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"With the support and support of the government, artificial intelligence and robots will become the slogan of technological innovation." Liu Jinchang said, "The continuous growth of artificial intelligence enterprises must be based on innovative ideas, seek different development, find suitable for themselves. The direction."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Li Deyi, chairman of the China Artificial Intelligence Society, also said: "In recent years, the research and application of artificial intelligence has shown an explosive growth trend. 'Made in China 2025' and 'Internet +' actions have put forward a major demand for artificial intelligence technology, and develop intelligence. Industry and smart economy require continuous innovation of artificial intelligence technology, which will provide many opportunities for entrepreneurial innovation in society."</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most recognized in the capital market is the development of new technologies. In fact, the current industrialization of artificial intelligence has become a hot trend of venture capital and an important starting point for the transformation and upgrading of many industries. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">International IT giants such as Google and IBM have rushed to lay out the artificial intelligence industry chain, trying to grasp the initiative in the era of artificial intelligence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A large number of graduates and high-tech talents have also poured into the field of artificial intelligence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In just five years, the investment in artificial intelligence has reached nearly 19 million US dollars, and a new wave of entrepreneurship is coming.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The vigorous development of artificial intelligence in the future will also have a huge impact on the industrial structure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“The development of artificial intelligence technology will have a major disruptive impact on traditional industries, and 'smart +x' will become an innovative fashion. Artificial intelligence will be widely used in defense, medical, industrial, agricultural, financial, commercial, educational, public safety and other fields. , spawned new formats and business models, leading to profound changes in the industrial structure." Tan Tieniu said.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">　Perhaps the first to be changed by artificial intelligence will be the service industry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to experts, the most research investment is still the civilian service intelligent robot. In addition, from the user's point of view, the elderly and children are becoming the focus of artificial intelligence investment - artificial intelligence robots will take the lead in nursing and accompanying elderly children. The work is on the big picture.</font></font></p>
            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many people believe that there is an infinite treasure in the rich mine of artificial intelligence, and entrepreneurial innovation in this field will greatly enhance the development process of human beings - the second era of machine revolution is coming, and countless intelligent machines will The multitude of interconnected intelligent brains combine to help us understand and change the world.</font></font></p>
